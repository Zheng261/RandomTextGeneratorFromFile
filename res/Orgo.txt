IS ORGANIC CHEMISTRY REALLY ALL
ABOUT MEMORIZATION?
Is organic chemistry really as tough as everyone says it is? The answer is yes and no.
Yes, because you will spend more time on organic chemistry than you would spend
in a course on underwater basket weaving. And no, because those who say it’s so
tough have studied inefficiently. Ask around, and you will find that most students
think of organic chemistry as a memorization game. This is not true! Former organic
chemistry students perpetuate the false rumor that organic chemistry is the toughest
class on campus, because it makes them feel better about the poor grades that they
received.
If it’s not about memorizing, then what is it? To answer this question, let’s
compare organic chemistry to a movie. Picture in your mind a movie where the plot
changes every second. If you’re in a movie theatre watching a movie like that, you
can’t leave even for a second because you would miss something important to the
plot. So you try your hardest to wait until the movie is over before going to the bathroom.
Sound familiar?
Organic chemistry is very much the same. It is one long story, and the
story actually makes sense if you pay attention. The plot constantly develops, and
everything ties into the plot. If your attention wanders for too long, you could
easily get lost.
OK, so it’s a long movie. But don’t I need to memorize it? Of course, there are
some things you need to memorize. You need to know some important terminology
and some other concepts that require a bit of memorization, but the amount of pure
memorization is not that large. If I were to give you a list of 100 numbers, and I
asked you to memorize them all for an exam, you would probably be very upset by
this. But at the same time, you can probably tell me at least 10 telephone numbers
off the top of your head. Each one of those has 10 digits (including the area codes).
You never sat down to memorize all 10 telephone numbers. Rather, over time you
slowly became accustomed to dialing those numbers until the point that you knew
them. Let’s see how this works in our movie analogy.
You probably know at least one person who has seen one movie more than five
times and can quote every line by heart. How can this person do that? It’s not because
he or she tried to memorize the movie. The first time you watch a movie, you
learn the plot. After the second time, you understand why individual scenes are necessary
to develop the plot. After the third time, you understand why the dialogue was
necessary to develop each scene. After the fourth time, you are quoting many of the
INTRODUCTION

lines by heart. Never at any time did you make an effort to memorize the lines. You
know them because they make sense in the grand scheme of the plot. If I were to give
you a screenplay for a movie and ask you to memorize as much as you can in 10
hours, you would probably not get very far into it. If, instead, I put you in a room for
10 hours and played the same movie over again five times, you would know most of
the movie by heart, without even trying. You would know everyone’s names, the
order of the scenes, much of the dialogue, and so on.
Organic chemistry is exactly the same. It’s not about memorization. It’s all
about making sense of the plot, the scenes, and the individual concepts that make up
our story. Of course you will need to remember all of the terminology, but with
enough practice, the terminology will become second nature to you. So here’s a brief
preview of the plot.
THE PLOT
The first half of our story builds up to reactions, and we learn about the characteristics
of molecules that help us understand reactions. We begin by looking at atoms,
the building blocks of molecules, and what happens when they combine to form
bonds. We focus on special bonds between certain atoms, and we see how the nature
of bonds can affect the shape and stability of molecules. At this point, we need
a vocabulary to start talking about molecules, so we learn how to draw and name
molecules. We see how molecules move around in space, and we explore the relationships
between similar types of molecules. At this point, we know the important
characteristics of molecules, and we are ready to use our knowledge to explore
reactions.
Reactions take up the rest of the course, and they are typically broken down
into chapters based on categories. Within each of these chapters, there is actually a
subplot that fits into the grand story.
HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
This book will help you study more efficiently so that you can avoid wasting countless
hours. It will point out the major scenes in the plot of organic chemistry. The
book will review the critical principles and explain why they are relevant to the rest
of the course. In each section, you will be given the tools to better understand your
textbook and lectures, as well as plenty of opportunities to practice the key skills that
you will need to solve problems on exams. In other words, you will learn the language
of organic chemistry. This book cannot replace your textbook, your lectures,
or other forms of studying. This book is not the Cliff Notes of Organic Chemistry. It
focuses on the basic concepts that will empower you to do well if you go to lectures
and study in addition to using this book. To best use this book, you need to know
how to study in this course.
iv INTRODUCTION
HOW TO STUDY
There are two separate aspects to this course:
1. Understanding principles
2. Solving problems
Although these two aspects are completely different, instructors will typically gauge
your understanding of the principles by testing your ability to solve problems. So
you must master both aspects of the course. The principles are in your lecture notes,
but you must discover how to solve problems. Most students have a difficult time
with this task. In this book, we explore some step-by-step processes for analyzing
problems. There is a very simple habit that you must form immediately: learn to ask
the right questions.
If you go to a doctor with a pain in your stomach, you will get a series of questions:
How long have you had the pain? Where is the pain? Does it come and go, or
is it constant? What was the last thing you ate? and so on. The doctor is doing two
very important and very different things. First, he has learned the right questions to
ask. Next, he applies the knowledge he has together with the information he has
gleaned to arrive at the proper diagnosis. Notice that the first step is asking the right
questions.
Let’s imagine that you want to sue McDonald’s because you spilled hot coffee
in your lap. You go to an attorney and she asks you a series of questions that enable
her to apply her knowledge to your case. Once again, the first step is asking questions.
In fact, in any profession or trade, the first step of diagnosing a problem is always
to ask questions. Let’s say you are trying to decide if you really want to be a
doctor. There are some tough, penetrating questions that you should be asking yourself.
It all boils down to learning how to ask the right questions.
The same is true with solving problems in this course. Unfortunately, you are
expected to learn how to do this on your own. In this book, we will look at some
common types of problems and we will see what questions you should be asking in
those circumstances. More importantly, we will also be developing skills that will
allow you to figure out what questions you should be asking for a problem that you
have never seen before.
Many students freak out on exams when they see a problem that they can’t do.
If you could hear what was going on in their minds, it would sound something like
this: “I can’t do it . . . I’m gonna flunk.” These thoughts are counterproductive and a
waste of precious time. Remember that when all else fails, there is always one question
that you can ask yourself: “What questions should I be asking right now?”
The only way to truly master problem-solving is to practice problems every
day, consistently. You will never learn how to solve problems by just reading a book.
You must try, and fail, and try again. You must learn from your mistakes. You must
get frustrated when you can’t solve a problem. That’s the learning process. Whenever
you encounter an exercise in this book, pick up a pencil and work on it. Don’t skip
over the problems! They are designed to foster skills necessary for problem-solving.
INTRODUCTION v
The worst thing you can do is to read the solutions and think that you now
know how to solve problems. It doesn’t work that way. If you want an A, you will
need to sweat a little (no pain, no gain). And that doesn’t mean that you should spend
day and night memorizing. Students who focus on memorizing will experience the
pain, but few of them will get an A.
The simple formula: Review the principles until you understand how each of
them fits into the plot; then focus all of your remaining time on solving problems.
Don’t worry. The course is not that bad if you approach it with the right attitude. This
book will act as a road map for your studying efforts.

To do well in organic chemistry, you must first learn to interpret the drawings that
organic chemists use. When you see a drawing of a molecule, it is absolutely critical
that you can read all of the information contained in that drawing. Without this
skill, it will be impossible to master even the most basic reactions and concepts.
Molecules can be drawn in many ways. For example, below are three different
ways of drawing the same molecule:
Without a doubt, the last structure (bond-line drawing) is the quickest to draw, the
quickest to read, and the best way to communicate. Open to any page in the second half
of your textbook and you will find that every page is plastered with bond-line drawings.
Most students will gain a familiarity with these drawings over time, not realizing how
absolutely critical it is to be able to read these drawings fluently. This chapter will help
you develop your skills in reading these drawings quickly and fluently.
1.1 HOW TO READ BOND-LINE DRAWINGS
Bond-line drawings show the carbon skeleton (the connections of all the carbon
atoms that build up the backbone, or skeleton, of the molecule) with any functional
groups that are attached, such as – OH or – Br. Lines are drawn in a zigzag format,
where each corner or endpoint represents a carbon atom. For example, the following
compound has 7 carbon atoms:
It is a common mistake to forget that the ends of lines represent carbon atoms as
well. For example, the following molecule has six carbon atoms (make sure you can
count them):

CHAPTER1
BOND-LINE DRAWINGS
Double bonds are shown with two lines, and triple bonds are shown with three lines:
When drawing triple bonds, be sure to draw them in a straight line rather than zigzag,
because triple bonds are linear (there will be more about this in the chapter on geometry).
This can be quite confusing at first, because it can get hard to see just how
many carbon atoms are in a triple bond, so let’s make it clear:
It is common to see a small gap on either side of a triple bond, like this:
Both drawings above are commonly used, and you should train your eyes to see
triple bonds either way. Don’t let triple bonds confuse you. The two carbon atoms of
the triple bond and the two carbons connected to them are drawn in a straight line.
All other bonds are drawn as a zigzag:

five carbon atoms:

2 CHAPTER 1 BOND-LINE DRAWINGS
Now that we know how to count carbon atoms, we must learn how to count
the hydrogen atoms in a bond-line drawing of a molecule. Most hydrogen atoms are
not shown, so bond-line drawings can be drawn very quickly. Hydrogen atoms connected
to atoms other carbon (such as nitrogen or oxygen) must be drawn:
But hydrogen atoms connected to carbon are not drawn. Here is the rule for determining
how many hydrogen atoms there are on each carbon atom: neutral carbon
atoms have a total of four bonds. In the following drawing, the highlighted carbon
atom is showing only two bonds:
Therefore, it is assumed that there are two more bonds to hydrogen atoms (to give a
total of four bonds). This is what allows us to avoid drawing the hydrogen atoms and
to save so much time when drawing molecules. It is assumed that the average person
knows how to count to four, and therefore is capable of determining the number
of hydrogen atoms even though they are not shown.
So you only need to count the number of bonds that you can see on a carbon atom,
and then you know that there should be enough hydrogen atoms to give a total of four
We only see two bonds
connected to this carbon atom

you do not need to count anymore. You will simply get accustomed to seeing these types
of drawings, and you will be able to instantly “see” all of the hydrogen atoms without
counting them. Now we will do some exercises that will help you get to that point.

4 CHAPTER 1 BOND-LINE DRAWINGS

Now we can understand why we save so much time by using bond-line drawings. Of
course, we save time by not drawing every C and H. But, there is an even larger benefit
to using these drawings. Not only are they easier to draw, but they are easier to
read as well. Take the following reaction for example:
It is somewhat difficult to see what is happening in the reaction. You need to stare
at it for a while to see the change that took place. However, when we redraw
the reaction using bond-line drawings, the reaction becomes very easy to read
immediately:
As soon as you see the reaction, you immediately know what is happening. In
this reaction we are converting a double bond into a single bond by adding two
hydrogen atoms across the double bond. Once you get comfortable reading
these drawings, you will be better equipped to see the changes taking place in
reactions.
1.2 HOW TO DRAW BOND-LINE DRAWINGS
Now that we know how to read these drawings, we need to learn how to draw them.
Take the following molecule as an example:
To draw this as a bond-line drawing, we focus on the carbon skeleton, making sure
to draw any atoms other than C and H. All atoms other than carbon and hydrogen
must be drawn. So the example above would look like this:

1.2 HOW TO DRAW BOND-LINE DRAWINGS 5
A few pointers may be helpful before you do some problems.
1. Don’t forget that carbon atoms in a straight chain are drawn in a zigzag format:
2. When drawing double bonds, try to draw the other bonds as far away from
the double bond as possible:
3. When drawing zigzags, it does not matter in which direction you start drawing:

6 CHAPTER 1 BOND-LINE DRAWINGS

1.3 MISTAKES TO AVOID
1. Never draw a carbon atom with more than four bonds. This is a big nono.
Carbon atoms only have four orbitals; therefore, carbon atoms can
form only four bonds (bonds are formed when orbitals of one atom overlap
with orbitals of another atom). This is true of all second-row elements,
and we discuss this in more detail in the chapter on drawing resonance
structures.
2. When drawing a molecule, you should either show all of the H’s and all of
the C’s, or draw a bond-line drawing where the C’s and H’s are not drawn.
You cannot draw the C’s without also drawing the H’s:
This drawing is no good. Either leave out the C’s (which is preferable) or
put in the H’s:
3. When drawing each carbon atom in a zigzag, try to draw all of the bonds
as far apart as possible:
1.4 MORE EXERCISES
First, open your textbook and flip through the pages in the second half. Choose any bondline
drawing and make sure that you can say with confidence how many carbon atoms
you see and how many hydrogen atoms are attached to each of those carbon atoms.

1.4 MORE EXERCISES 7
Now try to look at the following reaction and determine what changes took place:
Do not worry about how the changes took place. You will understand that later when
you learn the mechanism of the reaction. For now, just focus on explaining what
change took place. For the example above, we can say that we added two hydrogen
atoms to the molecule (one on either end of the double bond).
Consider another example:
In this example, we have eliminated an H and a Br to form a double bond. (We will
see later that it is actually H and Br that are eliminated, when we get into the
chapters on mechanisms). If you cannot see that an H was eliminated, then you will
need to count the number of hydrogen atoms in the starting material and compare it
with the product:
Now consider one more example:
In this example, we have substituted a bromine with a chlorine.
PROBLEMS For each of the following reactions, clearly state what change has
taken place. In each case your sentence should start with one of the following
opening clauses: we have added . . . , we have eliminated . . . , or we have

1.5 IDENTIFYING FORMAL CHARGES
Formal charges are charges (either positive or negative) that we must often include
in our drawings. They are extremely important. If you don’t draw a formal charge
when it is supposed to be drawn, then your drawing will be incomplete (and wrong).
So you must learn how to identify when you need formal charges and how to draw
them. If you cannot do this, then you will not be able to draw resonance structures
(which we see in the next chapter), and if you can’t do that, then you will have a very
hard time passing this course.
A formal charge is a charge associated with an atom that does not exhibit the
expected number of valence electrons. When calculating the formal charge on an
atom, we first need to know the number of valence electrons the atom is supposed
to have. We can get this number by inspecting the periodic table, since each column
of the periodic table indicates the number of expected valence electrons (valence
electrons are the electrons in the valence shell, or the outermost shell of electrons—
you probably remember this from high school chemistry). For example, carbon is
in Column 4A, and therefore has four valence electrons. Now you know how to
determine how many electrons the atom is supposed to have.
Next we ask how many electrons the atom actually has in the drawing. But
how do we count this?
Let’s see an example. Consider the central carbon atom in the compound
below:
Remember that every bond represents two electrons being shared between two
atoms. Begin by splitting each bond apart, placing one electron on this atom and one
electron on that atom:
H3C C CH3
H
O
H
H3C C CH3
H
O

Now count the number of electrons immediately surrounding the central carbon
atom:
There are four electrons. This is the number of electrons that the atom actually has.
Now we are in a position to compare how many valence electrons the atom is
supposed to have (in this case, four) with how many valence electrons it actually
has (in this case, four). Since these numbers are the same, the carbon atom has no
formal charge. This will be the case for most of the atoms in the structures you will
draw in this course. But in some cases, there will be a difference between the number
of electrons the atom is supposed to have and the number of electrons the atom
actually has. In those cases, there will be a formal charge. So let’s see an example
of an atom that has a formal charge.
Consider the oxygen atom in the structure below:
Let’s begin by determining the number of valence electrons that an oxygen atom is
supposed to have. Oxygen is in Column 6A of the periodic table, so oxygen should
have six valence electrons. Next, we need to look at the oxygen atom in this compound
and ask how many valence electrons it actually has. So, we redraw the stucture
by splitting up the C–O bond:
In addition to the electron on the oxygen from the C–O bond, the oxygen also
has three lone pairs. A lone pair is when you have two electrons that are not
being used to form a bond. Lone pairs are drawn as two dots on an atom, and the
oxygen above has three of these lone pairs. You must remember to count each
lone pair as two electrons. So we see that the oxygen atom actually has seven
electrons, which is one more electron than it is supposed to have. Therefore, it
will have a negative charge:

if it has a formal charge:
Answer Nitrogen is in Column 5A of the periodic table so it should have five electrons.
Now we count how many it actually has:
It only has four. So, it has one less electron than it is supposed to have. Therefore,
this nitrogen atom has a positive charge:

This brings us to the most important atom of all: carbon. We saw before that
carbon always has four bonds. This allows us to ignore the hydrogen atoms when
drawing bond-line structures, because it is assumed that we know how to count to
four and can figure out how many hydrogen atoms are there. When we said that,
we were only talking about carbon atoms without formal charges (most carbon
atoms in most structures will not have formal charges). But now that we have
learned what a formal charge is, let’s consider what happens when carbon has a
formal charge.
If carbon bears a formal charge, then we cannot just assume the carbon has
four bonds. In fact, it will have only three. Let’s see why. Let’s first consider C, and
then we will move on to C.
If carbon has a positive formal charge, then it has only three electrons (it is
supposed to have four electrons, because carbon is in Column 4A of the periodic
table). Since it has only three electrons, it can form only three bonds. That’s it. So,
a carbon with a positive formal charge will have only three bonds, and you should
keep this in mind when counting hydrogen atoms:
Now let’s consider what happens when we have a carbon atom with a
negative formal charge. The reason it has a negative formal charge is because it
has one more electron than it is supposed to have. Therefore, it has five electrons.
Two of these electrons form a lone pair, and the other three electrons are
used to form bonds:
We have the lone pair, because we can’t use each of the five electrons to form
a bond. Carbon can never have five bonds. Why not? Electrons exist in regions of
space called orbitals. These orbitals can overlap with orbitals from other atoms to
form bonds, or the orbitals can contain two electrons (which is called a lone pair).
Carbon has only four orbitals, so there is no way it could possibly form five
bonds—it does not have five orbitals to use to form those bonds. This is why a
carbon atom with a negative charge will have a lone pair (if you look at the drawing
above, you will count four orbitals—one for the lone pair and then three more
for the bonds).

Therefore, a carbon atom with a negative charge can also form only three
bonds (just like a carbon with a positive charge). When you count hydrogen atoms,
you should keep this in mind:
1.6 FINDING LONE PAIRS THAT ARE NOT DRAWN
From all of the cases above (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon), you can see why you have
to know how many lone pairs there are on an atom in order to figure out the formal
charge on that atom. Similarly, you have to know the formal charge to figure out
how many lone pairs there are on an atom. Take the case below with the nitrogen
atom shown:
If the lone pairs were drawn, then we would be able to figure out the charge (two
lone pairs would mean a negative charge and one lone pair would mean a positive
charge). Similarly, if the formal charge was drawn, we would be able to figure out
how many lone pairs there are (a negative charge would mean two lone pairs and a
positive charge would mean one lone pair). So you can see that drawings must include
either lone pairs or formal charges. The convention is to always show formal
charges and to leave out the lone pairs. This is much easier to draw, because you usually
won’t have more than one charge on a drawing (if even that), so you get to save
time by not drawing every lone pair on every atom.
Now that we have established that formal charges must always be drawn and
that lone pairs are usually not drawn, we need to get practice in how to see the lone
pairs when they are not drawn. This is not much different from training yourself to
see all the hydrogen atoms in a bond-line drawing even though they are not drawn.
If you know how to count, then you should be able to figure out how many lone pairs
are on an atom where the lone pairs are not drawn.
Let’s see an example to demonstrate how you do this:
In this case, we are looking at an oxygen atom. Oxygen is in Column 6A of the periodic
table, so it is supposed to have six electrons. Then, we need to take the formal
charge into account. This oxygen atom has a negative charge, which means one extra
electron. Therefore, this oxygen atom must have 6  1  7 electrons. Now we can
figure out how many lone pairs there are.

14 CHAPTER 1 BOND-LINE DRAWINGS
The oxygen atom has one bond, which means that it is using one of its seven
electrons to form a bond. The other six must be in lone pairs. Since each lone pair is
two electrons, this must mean that there are three lone pairs:
Let’s review the process:
1. Count the number of electrons the atom should have according to the
periodic table.
2. Take the formal charge into account. A negative charge means one more
electron, and a positive charge means one less electron.
3. Now you know the number of electrons the atom actually has. Use this
number to figure out how many lone pairs there are.
Now we need to get used to the common examples. Although it is important
that you know how to count and determine numbers of lone pairs, it is actually much
more important to get to a point where you don’t have to waste time counting. You
need to get familiar with the common situations you will encounter. Let’s go through
them methodically.
When oxygen has no formal charge, it will have two bonds and two lone pairs:
If oxygen has a negative formal charge, then it must have one bond and three

Answer The oxygen atom has a positive formal charge and three bonds. You
should try to get to a point where you recognize that this must mean that the oxygen
atom has one lone pair:
Until you get to the point where you can recognize this, you should be able to figure
out the answer by counting.
Oxygen is supposed to have six electrons. This oxygen atom has a positive
charge, which means it is missing an electron. Therefore, this oxygen atom must
have 6  1  5 electrons. Now, we can figure out how many lone pairs there are.
The oxygen atom has three bonds, which means that it is using three of its
five electrons to form bonds. The other two must be in a lone pair. So there is only
one lone pair.

Answer The central nitrogen atom has a positive formal charge and four bonds.
You should try to get to a point where you recognize that this nitrogen atom does not
have any lone pairs. Each of the other nitrogen atoms has a negative formal charge
and two bonds. You should try to get to a point where you recognize that each of
these nitrogen atoms has two lone pairs:
Until you get to the point where you can recognize this, you should be able to
figure out the answer by counting. Nitrogen is supposed to have five electrons.
The central nitrogen atom has a positive charge, which means it is missing
an electron. In other words, this nitrogen atom must have 5  1  4 electrons.
Now, we can figure out how many lone pairs there are. Since it has four bonds,
it is using all of its electrons to form bonds. So there is no lone pair on this
nitrogen atom.
For each of the remaining nitrogen atoms, there is a negative formal charge.
That means that each of those nitrogen atoms has one extra electron, 5 1  6 electrons.
Each nitrogen atom has two bonds, which means that each nitrogen atom has
four electrons left over, giving two lone pairs.

In this chapter, you will learn the tools that you need to draw resonance structures
with proficiency. I cannot adequately stress the importance of this skill. Resonance
is the one topic that permeates the entire subject matter from start to finish. It finds
its way into every chapter, into every reaction, and into your nightmares if you do
not master the rules of resonance. You cannot get an A in this class without mastering
resonance. So what is resonance? And why do we need it?
2.1 WHAT IS RESONANCE?
In Chapter 1, we introduced one of the best ways of drawing molecules, bond-line
structures. They are fast to draw and easy to read, but they have one major deficiency:
they do not describe molecules perfectly. In fact, no drawing method can
completely describe a molecule using only a single drawing. Here is the problem.
Although our drawings are very good at showing which atoms are connected
to each other, our drawings are not good at showing where all of the electrons are,
because electrons aren’t really solid particles that can be in one place at one time.
All of our drawing methods treat electrons as particles that can be placed in specific
locations. Instead, it is best to think of electrons as clouds of electron density. We
don’t mean that electrons fly around in clouds; we mean that electrons are clouds.
These clouds often spread themselves across large regions of a molecule.
So how do we represent molecules if we can’t draw where the electrons are?
The answer is resonance. We use the term resonance to describe our solution to the
problem: we use more than one drawing to represent a single molecule. We draw
several drawings, and we call these drawings resonance structures. We meld these
drawings into one image in our minds. To better understand how this works, consider
the following analogy.
Your friend asks you to describe what a nectarine looks like, because he has
never seen one. You aren’t a very good artist so you say the following:
Picture a peach in your mind, and now picture a plum in your mind. Well, a
nectarine has features of both: the inside tastes like a peach, but the outside is
smooth like a plum. So take your image of a peach together with your image of
a plum and meld them together in your mind into one image. That’s a
nectarine.
It is important to realize that a nectarine does not switch back and forth every second
from being a peach to being a plum. A nectarine is a nectarine all of the time.
20
CHAPTER 2
RESONANCE
The image of a peach is not adequate to describe a nectarine. Neither is the image of
a plum. But by imagining both together at the same time, you can get a sense of what
a nectarine looks like.
The problem with drawing molecules is similar to the problem above with the
nectarine. No single drawing adequately describes the nature of the electron density
spread out over the molecule. To solve this problem, we draw several drawings and
then meld them together in our mind into one image. Just like the nectarine.
Let’s see an example:
The compound above has two important resonance structures. Notice that we separate
resonance structures with a straight, two-headed arrow, and we place brackets
around the structures. The arrow and brackets indicate that they are resonance
structures of one molecule. The molecule is not flipping back and forth between
the different resonance structures.
Now that we know why we need resonance, we can begin to understand why
resonance structures are so important. Ninety-five percent of the reactions that you
will see in this course occur because one molecule has a region of low electron density
and the other molecule has a region of high electron density. They attract each
other in space, which causes a reaction. So, to predict how and when two molecules
will react with each other, we must first predict where there is low electron density
and where there is high electron density. We need to have a firm grasp of resonance
to do this. In this chapter, we will see many examples of how to predict the regions
of low or high electron density by applying the rules of drawing resonance structures.
2.2 CURVED ARROWS: THE TOOLS FOR
DRAWING RESONANCE STRUCTURES
In the beginning of the course, you might encounter problems like this: here is a
drawing; now draw the other resonance structures. But later on in the course, it will
be assumed and expected that you can draw all of the resonance structures of a compound.
If you cannot actually do this, you will be in big trouble later on in the course.
So how do you draw all of the resonance structures of a compound? To do this, you
need to learn the tools that help you: curved arrows.
Here is where it can be confusing as to what is exactly going on. These arrows
do not represent an actual process (such as electrons moving). This is an important
point, because you will learn later about curved arrows used in drawing reaction
mechanisms. Those arrows look exactly the same, but they actually do refer to the
flow of electron density. In contrast, curved arrows here are used only as tools to help
2.2 CURVED ARROWS:THE TOOLS FOR DRAWING RESONANCE STRUCTURES 21
22 CHAPTER 2 RESONANCE
us draw all resonance structures of a molecule. The electrons are not actually moving.
It can be tricky because we will say things like: “this arrow shows the electrons
coming from here and going to there.” But we don’t actually mean that the electrons
are moving; they are not moving. Since each drawing treats the electrons as particles
stuck in one place, we will need to “move” the electrons to get from one drawing to
another. Arrows are the tools that we use to make sure that we know how to draw all
resonance structures for a compound. So, let’s look at the features of these important
curved arrows.
Every curved arrow has a head and a tail. It is essential that the head and tail
of every arrow be drawn in precisely the proper place. The tail shows where the electrons
are coming from, and the head shows where the electrons are going (remember
that the electrons aren’t really going anywhere, but we treat them as if they were
so we can make sure to draw all resonance structures):
Therefore, there are only two things that you have to get right when drawing an
arrow: the tail needs to be in the right place and the head needs to be in the right
place. So we need to see rules about where you can and where you cannot draw arrows.
But first we need to talk a little bit about electrons, since the arrows are describing
the electrons.
Atomic orbitals can hold a maximum of two electrons. So, there only three options
for any atomic orbital:
So we see that electrons can be found in two places: in bonds or in lone pairs.
Therefore, electrons can only come from either a bond or a lone pair. Similarly, electrons
can only go to form either a bond or a lone pair.
Let’s focus on tails of arrows first. Remember that the tail of an arrow indicates
where the electrons are coming from. So the tail has to come from a place that
has electrons: either from a bond or from a lone pair. Consider the following resonance
structures as an example:

Tail Head
How do we get from the first structure to the second one? Notice that the electrons
that make up the double bond have been “moved.” This is an example of electrons
coming from a bond. Let’s see the arrow showing the electrons coming from the
bond and going to form another bond:
Now let’s see an example where electrons come from a lone pair:
Never draw an arrow that comes from a positive charge. The tail of an arrow
must come from a spot that has electrons.
Heads of arrows are just as simple as tails. The head of an arrow shows where
the electrons are going. So the head of an arrow must either point directly in between
two atoms to form a bond, like this:
or it must point to an atom to form a lone pair, like this:
Never draw the head of an arrow going off into space, like this:

2.2 CURVED ARROWS:THE TOOLS FOR DRAWING RESONANCE STRUCTURES 23
24 CHAPTER 2 RESONANCE
Remember that the head of an arrow shows where the electrons are going. So the
head of an arrow must point to a place where the electrons can go—either to form a
bond or to form a lone pair.
2.3 THE TWO COMMANDMENTS
Now we know what curved arrows are, but how do we know when to push them and
where to push them? First, we need to learn where we cannot push arrows. There are
two important rules that you should never violate when pushing arrows. They are the
“two commandments” of drawing resonance structures:
1. Thou shall not break a single bond.
2. Thou shall not exceed an octet for second-row elements.
Let’s focus on one at a time.
1. Never break a single bond when drawing resonance structures. By definition,
resonance structures must have all the same atoms connected in the same order.
Never break a single bond
There are very few exceptions to this rule, and only a trained organic chemist can be
expected to know when it is permissible to violate this rule. Some instructors might
violate this rule one or two times (about half-way through the course). If this happens,
you should recognize that you are seeing a very rare exception. In virtually
every situation that you will encounter, you cannot violate this rule. Therefore, you
must get into the habit of never breaking a single bond.
There is a simple way to ensure that you never violate this rule. Just make sure
that you never draw the tail of an arrow on a single bond.
2. Never exceed an octet for second-row elements. Elements in the second row
(C, N, O, F) have only four orbitals in their valence shell. Each of these four orbitals
can be used either to form a bond or to hold a lone pair. Each bond requires the use
of one orbital, and each lone pair requires the use of one orbital. So the second-row
elements can never have five or six bonds; the most is four. Similarly, they can never
have four bonds and a lone pair, because this would also require five orbitals. For
the same reason, they can never have three bonds and two lone pairs. The sum of
(bonds)  (lone pairs) for a second-row element can never exceed the number four.
Let’s see some examples of arrow pushing that violate this second commandment:
O C H
H
H
BAD ARROW
O N H
H
BAD ARROW
O O
H
BAD ARROW
In each of these drawings, the central atom cannot form another bond because it does
not have a fifth orbital that can be used. This is impossible. Don’t ever do this.
The examples above are clear, but with bond-line drawings, it can be more difficult
to see the violation because we cannot see the hydrogen atoms (and, very
often, we cannot see the lone pairs either; for now, we will continue to draw lone
pairs to ease you into it). You have to train yourself to see the hydrogen atoms and
to recognize when you are exceeding an octet:
At first it is difficult to see that the arrow on the left structure violates the second
commandment. But when we count the hydrogen atoms, we can see that the arrow
above would give a carbon atom with five bonds.
From now on, we will refer to the second commandment as “the octet rule.”
But be careful—for purposes of drawing resonance structures, it is only a violation
if we exceed an octet for a second-row element. However, there is no problem at all
with a second-row element having fewer than an octet of electrons. For example:
This drawing is perfectly acceptable, even though the central carbon atom has only
six electrons surrounding it. For our purposes, we will only consider the “octet rule”
to be violated if we exceed an octet.
Our two commandments (never break a single bond, and never violate “the
octet rule”) reflect the two parts of a curved arrow (the head and the tail). A bad tail
violates the first commandment, and a bad head violates the second commandment.
EXERCISE 2.1 For the compound below, look at the arrow drawn on the structure
and determine whether it violates either of the two commandments for drawing
resonance structures:
Answer First we need to ask if the first commandment has been violated: did we
break a single bond? To determine this, we look at the tail of the arrow. If the tail of
the arrow is coming from a single bond, then that means we are breaking that single
bond. If the tail is coming from a double bond, then we have not violated the first

2.3 THE TWO COMMANDMENTS 25
26 CHAPTER 2 RESONANCE
commandment. In this example, the tail is on a double bond, so we did not violate
the first commandment.
Now we need to ask if the second commandment has been violated: did we violate
the octet rule? To determine this, we look at the head of the arrow. Are we
forming a fifth bond? Remember that C only has three bonds, not four. When we
push the arrow shown above, the carbon atom will now get four bonds, and the second
commandment has not been violated.
The arrow above is valid, because the two commandments were not violated.
PROBLEMS For each of the problems below, determine which arrows violate
either one of the two commandments, and explain why. (Don’t forget to count all
hydrogen atoms and all lone pairs. You must do this to solve these problems.)

2.4 DRAWING GOOD ARROWS
Now that we know how to identify good arrows and bad arrows, we need to get some
practice drawing arrows. We know that the tail of an arrow must come either from a
bond or a lone pair, and that the head of an arrow must go to form a bond or a lone
pair. If we are given two resonance structures and are asked to show the arrow(s) that
get us from one resonance structure to the other, it makes sense that we need to look
for any bonds or lone pairs that are appearing or disappearing when going from one
structure to another. For example, consider the following resonance structures:
How would we figure out what curved arrow to draw to get us from the drawing on
the left to the drawing on the right? We must look at the difference between the two
structures and ask, “How should we push the electrons to get from the first structure
to the second structure?” Begin by looking for any double bonds or lone pairs that
are disappearing. That will tell us where to put the tail of our arrow. In this example,
there are no lone pairs disappearing, but there is a double bond disappearing. So we
know that we need to put the tail of our arrow on the double bond.
Now, we need to know where to put the head of the arrow. We look for any
lone pairs or double bonds that are appearing. We see that there is a new lone pair
appearing on the oxygen atom. This tell us where to put the head of the arrow:
Notice that when we move a double bond up onto an atom to form a lone pair,
it creates two formal charges: a positive charge on the carbon atom that lost its bond
and a negative charge on the oxygen atom that got a lone pair. This is a very important
issue. Formal charges were introduced in the previous chapter, and now they
will become instrumental in drawing resonance structures. For the moment, let’s just
focus on pushing arrows, and in the next section of this chapter, we will come back
to focus on these formal charges.

2.4 DRAWING GOOD ARROWS 27
It is pretty straightforward to see how to push only one arrow that gets us from
one resonance structure to another. But what about when we need to push more than
one arrow to get from one resonance structure to another? Let’s do an example like that.
EXERCISE 2.13 For the two structures below, try to draw the curved arrows that
get you from the drawing on the left to the drawing on the right:
Answer Let’s analyze the difference between these two drawings. We begin by
looking for any double bonds or lone pairs that are disappearing. We see that oxygen
is losing a lone pair, and the C¨C on the bottom is also disappearing. This
should automatically tell us that we need two arrows. To lose a lone pair and a double
bond, we will need two tails.
Now let’s look for any double bonds or lone pairs that are appearing. We see
that a C¨O is appearing and a C with a negative charge is appearing (remember
that a C means a C with a lone pair). This tells us that we need two heads, which
confirms that we need two arrows.
So we know we need two arrows. Let’s start at the top. We lose a lone pair
from the oxygen atom and form a C¨O. Let’s draw that arrow:
Notice that if we stopped here, we would be violating the second commandment.
The central carbon atom is getting five bonds. To avoid this problem, we must immediately
draw the second arrow. The C¨C disappears (which solves our octet
problem) and becomes a lone pair on carbon.
Arrow pushing is much like riding a bike. If you have never done it before, watching
someone else will not make you an expert. You have to learn how to balance yourself.
Watching someone else is a good start, but you have to get on the bike if you
want to learn. You will probably fall a few times, but that’s part of the learning
process. The same is true with arrow pushing. The only way to learn is with practice.
Now it’s time for you to get on the arrow-pushing bike. You would never be
stupid enough to try riding a bike for the first time next to a steep cliff. Do not have
your first arrow-pushing experience be during your exam. Practice right now!

2.5 FORMAL CHARGES IN
RESONANCE STRUCTURES
Now we know how to draw good arrows (and how to avoid drawing bad arrows). In
the last section, we were given the resonance structures and just had to draw the
arrows. Now we need to take this to the next level. We need to get practice drawing
the resonance structures when they are not given. To ease into it, we will still show
the arrows, and we will focus on drawing the resonance structures with proper
formal charges. Consider the following example:
In this example, we can see that one of the lone pairs on oxygen is coming down to
form a bond, and the C¨C double bond is being pushed to form a lone pair on a
carbon atom. When both arrows are pushed at the same time, we are not violating
either of the two commandments. So, let’s focus on how to draw the resonance
structure. Since we know what arrows mean, it is easy to follow the arrows. We
just get rid of one lone pair on oxygen, place a double bond between carbon and
oxygen, get rid of the carbon–carbon double bond, and place a lone pair on carbon:
O
O
The arrows are really a language, and they tell us what to do. But here comes the
tricky part: we cannot forget to put formal charges on the new drawing. If we apply
the rules of assigning formal charges, we see that oxygen gets a positive charge and
carbon gets a negative charge. As long as we draw these charges, it is not necessary
to draw in the lone pairs:
It is absolutely critical to draw these formal charges. Structures drawn without them
are wrong. In fact, if you forget to draw the formal charges, then you are missing the
whole point of resonance. Let’s see why. Look at the resonance structure we just
drew. Notice that there is a negative charge on a carbon atom. This tells us that this
carbon atom is a site of high electron density. We would not know this by looking
only at the first drawing of the molecule:
This is why we need resonance—it shows us where there are regions of high and low
electron density. If we draw resonance structures without formal charges, then what
is the point in drawing the resonance structures at all?
Now that we see that proper formal charges are essential, we should make sure
that we know how to draw them when drawing resonance structures. If you are a little
bit shaky when it comes to formal charges, you can go back and review formal
charges in the previous chapter. More importantly, you should be able to draw formal
charges without having to count each time. We saw the common situations for
oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. It is important to remember those (go back and review
those if you need to).
Another way to assign formal charges is to read the arrows properly. Let’s look
at our example again:
Notice what the arrows are telling us: oxygen is giving up a lone pair (two electrons entirely
on oxygen) to form a bond (two electrons being shared: one for oxygen and one
for carbon). So oxygen is losing an electron. This tells us that it must get a positive
charge in the resonance structure. A similar analysis for the carbon atom on the bottom
right shows that it will get a negative charge. Remember that the electrons are not really
moving anywhere. Arrows are just tools that help us draw resonance structures. To use
these tools properly, we imagine that the electrons are moving, but they are not.
Now let’s practice.

30 CHAPTER 2 RESONANCE
EXERCISE 2.20 Draw the resonance structure that you get when you push the arrows
shown below. Be sure to include formal charges.
Answer We read the arrows to see what is happening. One of the lone pairs on
oxygen is coming down to form a bond, and the C¨C double bond is being pushed
to form a lone pair on a carbon atom. This is very similar to the example we just saw.
We just get rid of one lone pair on oxygen, place a double bond between carbon and
oxygen, get rid of the carbon–carbon double bond, and place a lone pair on carbon.
Finally, we must draw any formal charges:
There is one subtle point that must be mentioned. We said that you do not need to
draw lone pairs—you only need to draw formal charges. There will be times when
you will see arrows being pushed on structures that do not have the lone pairs drawn.
When this happens, you might see an arrow coming from a negative charge:
The drawing on the left is the common way this is drawn. Just don’t forget that the
electrons are really coming from a lone pair (as seen in the drawing on the right).
One way to double check your drawing when you are done is to count the
total charge on the resonance structure that you draw. This total charge should
be the same as the structure you started with. So if the first structure has a negative
charge, then the resonance structure you draw should also have a negative charge.
If it doesn’t, then you know you did something wrong (this is known as conservation
of charge). You cannot change the total charge when drawing resonance
structures.
PROBLEMS For each of the structures below, draw the resonance structure that
you get when you push the arrows shown. Be sure to include formal charges. (Hint:
In some cases the lone pairs are drawn and in other cases they are not drawn. Be sure
to take them into account even if they are not drawn—you need to train yourself to
see lone pairs when they are not drawn.)

2.6 DRAWING RESONANCE
STRUCTURES—STEP BY STEP
Now we have all the tools we need. We know why we need resonance structures and
what they represent. We know what curved arrows represent. We know how to recognize
bad arrows that violate the two commandments. We know how to draw arrows
that get you from one structure to another, and we know how to draw formal charges.
We are now ready for the final challenge: using curved arrows to draw resonance
structures.
First we need to locate the part of the molecule where resonance is an issue.
Remember that we can push electrons only from lone pairs or bonds. We don’t need
to worry about all bonds, because we can’t push an arrow from a single bond (that
would violate the first commandment). So we only care about double or triple
bonds. Double and triple bonds are called pi bonds. So we need to look for lone
pairs and pi bonds. Usually, only a small region of the molecule will possess either
of these features.
Once we have located the regions where resonance is an issue, now we need
to ask if there is any way to push the electrons without violating the two commandments.
Let’s be methodical, and break this up into three questions:
1. Can we convert any lone pairs into pi bonds without violating the two
commandments?
2. Can we convert any pi bonds into lone pairs without violating the two
commandments?
3. Can we convert any pi bonds into pi bonds without violating the two
commandments?
We do not need to worry about the fourth possibility (converting a lone pair into a
lone pair) because electrons cannot jump from one atom to another. Only the three
possibilities above are acceptable.
Let’s go through these three steps, one at a time, starting with step 1, converting
lone pairs into bonds. Consider the following example:
We ask if there are any lone pairs that we can move to form a pi bond. So we draw
an arrow that brings the lone pair down to form a pi bond:
N N
N
2.6 DRAWING RESONANCE STRUCTURES—STEP BY STEP 33
This does not violate either of the two commandments. We did not break any single
bonds and we did not violate the octet rule. So this is a valid structure. Notice that
we cannot move the lone pair in another direction, because then we would be violating
the octet rule:
Let’s try again with the following example:
We ask if we can move one of the lone pairs down to form a pi bond, so we try to
draw it:
This violates the octet rule—the carbon atom would end up with five bonds. So we
cannot push the arrows that way. There is no way to turn the lone pair into a pi bond
in this example.
Now let’s move on to step 2, converting pi bonds into lone pairs. We try to
move the double bond to form a lone pair and we see that we can move the bond in
either direction:
or
Neither of these structures violates the two commandments, so both structures above
are valid resonance structures. (However, the bottom structure, although valid, is not
a significant resonance structure. In the next section, we will see how to determine
which resonance structures are significant and which are not.)

34 CHAPTER 2 RESONANCE
For step 3, converting pi bonds into pi bonds, let’s consider the following
examples:
If we try to push the pi bonds to form other pi bonds, we find
The arrow on the top structure violates the octet rule (giving carbon five bonds),
and the arrow on the bottom structure does not violate the octet rule. The arrow
on the bottom structure will therefore provide a valid resonance structure:
Now that we have learned all three steps, we need to consider that these steps
can be combined. Sometimes we cannot do a step without violating the octet rule,
but by doing two steps at the same time, we can avoid violating the octet rule. For
example, if we try to turn a lone pair into a bond in the following structure, we see
that this would violate the octet rule:
If, at the same time, we also do step 2 (push a pi bond to become a lone pair), then
it works:
In other words, you should not always jump to the conclusion that pushing an arrow
will violate the octet rule. You should first look to see if you can push another arrow
that will eliminate the problem.
As another example, consider the following structure. We cannot move the C¨C
bond to become another bond unless we also move the C¨O bond to become a
lone pair:

In this way, we truly are “pushing” the electrons around.
Now we are ready to get some practice drawing resonance structures.
EXERCISE 2.29 Draw all resonance structures for the following compound:
Answer Let’s start by finding all of the lone pairs and redrawing the molecule.
Oxygen has two bonds here, so it must have two lone pairs (so that it will be using
all four orbitals):
Now let’s do step 1: can we convert any lone pairs into pi bonds? If we try to bring
down the lone pairs, we will violate the octet rule by forming a carbon atom with
five bonds:
Violates second commandment
The only way to avoid forming a fifth bond for carbon would be to push an arrow
that takes electrons away from that carbon. If we try to do this, we will break a single
bond and we will be violating the first commandment:

move that will not violate the two commandments:
So the resonance structures are
PROBLEM 2.30 For the following compound, go through all three steps (making
sure not to violate the two commandments) and draw the resonance structures.
While working through this problem, you probably found that it took a very
long time to think through every possibility, to count lone pairs, to worry about
violating the octet rule for each atom, to assign formal charges, and so on. Fortunately,
there is a way to avoid all of this tedious work. You can learn how to
become very quick and efficient at drawing resonance structures if you learn certain
patterns and train yourself to recognize those patterns. We will now develop
this skill.

2.7 DRAWING RESONANCE STRUCTURES—
BY RECOGNIZING PATTERNS
There are five patterns that you should learn to recognize to become proficient at
drawing resonance structures. First we list them, and then we will go through each
pattern in detail, with examples and exercises. Here they are:
1. A lone pair next to a pi bond.
2. A lone pair next to a positive charge.
3. A pi bond next to a positive charge.
4. A pi bond between two atoms, where one of those atoms is electronegative.
5. Pi bonds going all the way around a ring.
A Lone Pair Next to a Pi Bond
Consider the following two examples:
Both examples exhibit a lone pair “next to” the pi bond. “Next to” means that the
lone pair is separated from the double bond by exactly one single bond—no more
and no less. You can see this in all of the examples below:
In each of these cases, you can bring down the lone pair to form a pi bond, and kick
up the pi bond to form a lone pair:
Notice what happens with the formal charges. When the atom with the lone pair has
a negative charge, then it transfers its negative charge to the atom that will get a lone
pair in the end:

38 CHAPTER 2 RESONANCE
When the atom with the lone pair does not have a negative charge to begin with,
then it will end up with a positive charge in the end, while a negative charge will
go on the atom getting the lone pair in the end (remember conservation of
charge):
Once you learn to recognize this pattern (a lone pair next to a pi bond), you will be
able to save time in calculating formal charges and determining if the octet rule is
being violated. You will be able to push the arrows and draw the new resonance
structure without thinking about it.

two arrows: one from the lone pair to form a pi bond, and one from the pi bond to
form a lone pair.
Look carefully at the formal charges. The negative charge used to be on oxygen, but
now it moved to carbon.

Notice that in this problem, a negative and positive charge cancel each other to
become a double bond. There is one situation when we cannot combine charges to
give a double bond: the nitro group. The structure of the nitro group looks like this:
We cannot draw a resonance structure where there are no charges:
This might seem better at first, because we get rid of the charges, but our two commandments
show us why it cannot be drawn like this: the nitrogen atom would have
five bonds, which would violate the octet rule.
A Pi Bond Next to a Positive Charge
These cases are very easy to see:
We need only one arrow going from the pi bond to form a new pi bond:
Notice what happens to the formal charge in the process. It gets moved to the other end:
It is possible to have many double bonds in conjugation (this means that we have many
double bonds that are each separated by only one single bond) next to a positive charge:

It is not necessary to waste time recalculating formal charges for each resonance
structure, because the arrows indicate what is happening. Think of a positive charge
as a hole (a place that is missing an electron). When we push electrons to plug up
the hole, a new hole is created nearby. In this way, the hole is simply moved from
one location to another. Notice that the tails of the curved arrows are placed on the
pi bonds, not on the positive charge. Never place the tail of a curved arrow on a
positive charge (that is a common mistake).

bond system as conjugated:

move the electrons around in a circle:
It does not matter whether we push our arrows clockwise or counterclockwise
(either way gives us the same result, and remember that the electrons are not really
moving anyway).

3. A pi bond next to a positive charge.

2.8 ASSESSING THE RELATIVE
IMPORTANCE OF RESONANCE
STRUCTURES
Not all resonance structures are equally significant. A compound might have many
valid resonance structures (that do not violate the two commandments), but it is possible
that one or more resonance structures might be insignificant. To understand
what we mean when we say “insignificant,” let’s revisit the analogy we used in the
beginning of the chapter.
Recall that we used the analogy of a nectarine (being a hybrid between a peach
and plum) to explain the concept of resonance. Now, imagine that we create a new
type of fruit that is a hybrid between three fruits: a peach, a plum, and a kiwi. Suppose
that the hybrid fruit that we produce has the following character: 65% peach
character, 34% plum character, and 1% kiwi character. This hybrid fruit will look almost
exactly like a nectarine, because the amount of kiwi character is too small to
have an effect on the nature of the resulting hybrid. Even though this fruit is actually
a hybrid of three fruits, nevertheless it will look like a hybrid of only two fruits—
because the kiwi character is “insignificant.”
A similar concept exists when comparing resonance structures. One compound
might have three resonance structures, but all three resonance structures might not
contribute equally to the overall resonance hybrid. One resonance structure might be
the major contributor (like the peach), while another resonance structure might be insignificant
(like the kiwi). In order to understand the true nature of the compound, we
must be able to compare the resonance structures and determine which structures are
major contributors and which structures are not significant.
There are three simple rules to follow when comparing resonance structures.
At this point, you are probably thinking that it is hard enough to keep track of
Cl
O
O
O
2.8 ASSESSING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF RESONANCE STRUCTURES 47
everything we have seen so far—there are two commandments for how not to push
arrows, there are three steps for determining valid resonance structures, there are
five patterns, and now there are three rules for determining which resonance structures
are significant. The good news is that this is the end of the line. There are no
more rules or steps. We are almost done with resonance structures. More good
news—drawing resonance structures really is very much like riding a bike. When
you first learn to ride a bike, you need to concentrate on every movement to avoid
from falling. And you have to remember a lot of rules, such as which way to lean
your body and which way to turn the handlebars when you feel you are falling to
the left. But eventually, you get the hang of it, and then you can ride the bike with
no hands. The same is true here. It will take a lot of practice. But before you know
it, you will be the resonance guru, and that is where you need to be to do well in
this class.
Let’s see the three rules for determining which resonance structures are
significant:
Rule 1 Minimize charges. The best kind of structure is one without any charges. It
is OK to have two charges, but you should try to avoid structures that have more than
two charges. Compare the following two cases:
Both compounds have a pi bond between a carbon atom and an electronegative
atom (C¨O), and both compounds have a lone pair next to the pi bond. So we
would expect their resonance structures to be similar, and we would expect these
compounds to have the same number of significant resonance structures. But they
do not. Let’s see why. Let’s start by drawing the resonance structures of the first
compound:
The first resonance structure is the major contributor to the overall resonance hybrid,
because it has no charge separation. The other two drawings have charge separation,
but there are only two charges in each drawing, so they are both significant resonance
structures. They might not contribute as much character as the first resonance
structure does, but they are still significant. Therefore, this compound has three significant
resonance structures.
Now, let’s do the same thing for the other compound:

O
O
O
H H
O
O
H
Best OK OK
O
O
OH
O
48 CHAPTER 2 RESONANCE
The first and last structures are OK, but the second resonance structure is bad because
there are too many charges. This resonance structure is not significant, because
it will not contribute much character to the overall resonance hybrid. It is like the
kiwi in our analogy above. Therefore, we would say that this compound has only two
significant resonance structures.
There is one notable exception to this rule: compounds containing the nitro
group (NO2) will often have resonance structures with more than two charges.
Why? The nitro group looks like this:
Notice that we have two resonance structures, each of which has charge separation.
Even though the molecule has no net charge, nevertheless, we cannot draw a single
resonance structure that is free of charge. If we try to do so, we will end up with a
structure that violates the second commandment:
Nitrogen cannot have five bonds, so we cannot draw the nitro group without charges.
We must draw the nitro group with charge separation. Therefore, the two charges of
a nitro group don’t really count when we are counting charges. Consider the following
case as an example:
If we apply our rule (about limiting charge separation to no more than two charges),
then we might say that the second resonance structure above has too many charges

to be significant. But it actually is significant, because the two charges associated
with the nitro group are not included in our count. We would consider the resonance
structure above as if it only had two charges, and therefore, it is significant.
Rule 2 Electronegative atoms (such as N, O, Cl, etc.) can bear a positive charge,
but only if they possess an octet of electrons. Consider the following as an
example:
The second resonance structure above is significant, even though it has a positive
charge on oxygen. Why? Because the positively charged oxygen has an octet of
electrons (three bonds plus one lone pair  6  2  8 electrons). In fact, it is not
only significant, it is even more significant than the first resonance structure. Why?
In the first structure, oxygen has its octet, but carbon only has 6 electrons. In the
second resonance structure, both oxygen and carbon have their octet. This makes
the second resonance structure more significant, even though the positive charge is
on oxygen.
Here is another example, this time with the positive charge on nitrogen:
Once again, the second structure is significant (in fact, more significant than the first
resonance structure).
When a resonance structure has a positive charge on an electronegative atom,
that resonance structure will only be significant if the electronegative atom has an
octet. If it does not have an octet, the resonance structure will not be significant. For
example, consider the following:
In the example above, the second resonance structure has an oxygen with a positive
charge. But this oxygen does not have its octet, and therefore, this resonance structure
is not significant.

Rule 3 Avoid drawing a resonance structure in which two carbon atoms bear opposite
charges. Such resonance structures are generally insignificant, for example:
In this case, the third resonance structure is insignificant because it has both a C
and a C. The presence of carbon atoms with opposite charges, whether close to
each other (as in the example above) or far apart, renders the structure insignificant.

52 CHAPTER 2 RESONANCE
The first several chapters of any organic chemistry textbook focus on the structure
of molecules: how atoms connect to form bonds, how we draw those connections,
the problems with our drawing methods, how we name molecules, what molecules
look like in 3D, how molecules twist and bend in space, and so on. Only after gaining
a clear understanding of structure do we move on to reactions. But there seems
to be one exception: acid–base chemistry.
Acid–base chemistry is typically covered in one of the first few chapters of an
organic chemistry textbook, yet it might seem to belong better in the later chapters
on reactions. There is an important reason why acid–base chemistry is taught so
early on in your course. By understanding this reason, you will have a better perspective
of why acid–base chemistry is so incredibly important.
To appreciate the reason for teaching acid–base chemistry early in the course,
we need to first have a very simple understanding of what acid–base chemistry is all
about. Let’s summarize with a simple equation:
In the equation above, we see an acid (HA) on the left side of the equilibrium, and
the conjugate base (A) on the right side. HA is an acid by virtue of the fact that it
has a proton (H) to give. A is a base by virtue of the fact that it wants to take its
proton back (acids give protons and bases take protons). Since A is the base that
we get when we deprotonate HA, we call A the conjugate base of HA.
So the question is: how much is HA willing to give up its proton? If HA is
very willing to give up the proton, then HA is a strong acid. However, if HA is not
willing to give up its proton, then HA is a weak acid. So, how can we tell whether
or not HA is willing to give up its proton? We can figure it out by looking at the
conjugate base.
Notice that the conjugate base has a negative charge. The real question is: how
stable is that negative charge? If that charge is stable, then HA will be willing to give
up the proton, and therefore HA will be a strong acid. If that charge is not stable,
then HA will not be willing to give up its proton, and HA will be a weak acid.
So you only need one skill to completely master acid–base chemistry: you
need to be able to look at a negative charge and determine how stable that negative
charge is. If you can do that, then acid–base chemistry will be a breeze for you. If
you cannot determine charge stability, then you will have problems even after you
finish acid–base chemistry. To predict reactions, you need to know what kind of
charges are stable and what kind of charges are not stable.

ACID–BASE REACTIONS
Now you can understand why acid–base chemistry is taught so early in the
course. Charge stability is a vital part of understanding the structure of molecules. It
is so incredibly important because reactions are all about how charges interact with
one another. You cannot begin to discuss reactions until you have an excellent understanding
of what factors stabilize charges and what factors destabilize charges.
This chapter will focus on the four most important factors, one at a time.
3.1 FACTOR 1—WHAT ATOM IS
THE CHARGE ON?
The most important factor for determining charge stability is to ask what atom the
charge is on. For example, consider the following two structures:
The one on the left has a negative charge on oxygen, and the one on the right has the
charge on sulfur. How do we compare these? We look at the periodic table, and we
need to consider two trends: comparing atoms in the same row and comparing atoms
in the same column:
Let’s start with comparing atoms in the same row. For example, let’s compare
carbon and oxygen:
The structure on the left has the charge on carbon, and the structure on the right has
the charge on oxygen. Which one is more stable? Recall that electronegativity increases
as we move to the right on the periodic table:

54 CHAPTER 3 ACID–BASE REACTIONS
Since electronegativity is the measure of an element’s affinity for electrons (how
willing the atom will be to accept a new electron), we can say that a negative charge
on oxygen will be more stable than a negative charge on carbon.
Now let’s compare atoms in the same column, for example, iodide (I) and fluoride
(F). Here is where it gets a little bit tricky, because the trend is the opposite
of the electronegativity trend:
It is true that fluorine is more electronegative than iodine, but there is another more
important trend when comparing atoms in the same column: the size of the atom.
Iodine is huge compared to fluorine. So when a charge is placed on iodine, the
charge is spread out over a very large volume. When a charge is placed on fluorine,
the charge is stuck in a very small volume of space:
Even though fluorine is more electronegative than iodine, nevertheless, iodine can
better stabilize a negative charge. If I is more stable than F, then HI must be a
stronger acid than HF, because HI will be more willing to give up its proton than HF.
To summarize, there are two important trends: electronegativity (for comparing
atoms in the same row) and size (for comparing atoms in the same column). The
first factor (comparing atoms in the same row) is a much stronger effect. In other
words, the difference in stability between C and F is much greater than the difference
in stability between I and F.
Now we have all of the information we need to answer the question presented
earlier in this section: Which charge below is more stable?
When comparing these two ions, we see an oxygen atom bearing the negative charge
(on the left) and a sulfur atom bearing the negative charge (on the right). Oxygen and

sulfur are in the same column of the periodic table, so size is the important trend to
look at. Sulfur is larger than oxygen, so sulfur can better stabilize the negative charge.
EXERCISE 3.1 Compare the two protons highlighted below and determine which
one is more acidic.
Answer For each compound, we remove the highlighted proton and draw the
resulting conjugate base.
Now we need to compare these conjugate bases and ask which one is more stable. In
other words, which negative charge is more stable? We are comparing a negative charge
on nitrogen with a negative charge on oxygen. So we are comparing two atoms in the
same row of the periodic table, and the important trend is electronegativity. Oxygen can
better stabilize the negative charge, because oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen.
The proton on oxygen will be more willing to come off, so it is more acidic:

3.2 FACTOR 2—RESONANCE
The previous chapter was devoted solely to drawing resonance structures. If you
have not yet completed that chapter, do so before you begin this section. We said
in the previous chapter that resonance would find its way into every single topic in
organic chemistry. And here it is in acid–base chemistry.
To see how resonance plays a role here, let’s compare the following two
compounds:
In both cases, we remove a proton, resulting in a charge on oxygen:
So we cannot use factor 1 (what atom is the charge on) to determine which proton is
more acidic. In both cases, we are dealing with a negative charge on oxygen. But
there is a critical difference between these two negative charges. The first one is stabilized
by resonance, as shown here:

3.2 FACTOR 2—RESONANCE 57
Remember what resonance means. It does not mean that we have two structures
that are in equilibrium. Rather, it means that there is only one compound, and
we cannot use one drawing to adequately describe where the charge is. In reality, the
charge is spread out equally over both oxygen atoms. To see this, we need to draw
both drawings.
So what does this do in terms of stabilizing the negative charge? Imagine that
you have a hot potato in your hand (too hot to hold for long). If you could grab another
potato that is cold and transfer half of the warmth to the second potato, then
you would have two potatoes, each of which is not too hot to hold. It’s the same concept
here. When we spread a charge over more than one atom, we call the charge
“delocalized.” A delocalized negative charge is more stable than a localized negative
charge (stuck on one atom):
This factor is very important and explains why carboxylic acids are acidic:
They are acidic because the conjugate base is stabilized by resonance. It is worth
noting that carboxylic acids are not terribly acidic. They are acidic when compared
with other organic compounds, such as alcohols and amines, but not very acidic
when compared with inorganic acids, such as sulfuric acid or nitric acid. In the equilibrium
above showing a carboxylic acid losing a proton, we have one molecule losing
its proton for every 10,000 molecules that do not give up their proton. In the
world of acidity, this is not very acidic, but everything is relative.
So we have learned that resonance (which delocalizes a negative charge) is a
stabilizing factor. The question now is how to roughly determine how stabilizing this
factor is. Consider, for example, the following case:
The negative charge is stabilized over four atoms: one oxygen atom and three carbon
atoms. Even though carbon is not as happy with a negative charge as oxygen is,
nevertheless, it is better to spread the charge over one oxygen and three carbon atoms
than to leave the negative charge stuck on one oxygen. Spreading the charge around
helps to stabilize that charge.

O charge is stuck on one atom ("localized")
58 CHAPTER 3 ACID–BASE REACTIONS
But the number of atoms sharing the charge isn’t everything. For example, it
is better to have the charge spread over two oxygen atoms than to have the charge
spread over one oxygen and three carbon atoms:
So now we have the basic framework to compare two compounds that are both
resonance stabilized. We need to compare the compounds, keeping in mind the rules
we just learned:
1. The more delocalized the better. A charge spread over four atoms is more
stable than a charge spread over two atoms, but
2. One oxygen is better than many carbon atoms.
Now let’s do some problems.
EXERCISE 3.6 Compare the two protons highlighted below and determine which
one is more acidic.
Answer We begin by pulling off one proton and drawing the conjugate base that
we get. Then we do the same thing for the other proton:
Now we need to compare these conjugate bases and ask which one is more stable.
In the structure on the left, we are looking at a charge that is localized on a nitrogen
atom. For the structure on the right, the negative charge is delocalized over a nitrogen
atom and an oxygen atom (draw resonance structures). It is more stable for the
charge to be delocalized, so the second structure is more stable.
The more acidic proton is that one that leaves to give the more stable conjugate
base.

3.3 FACTOR 3—INDUCTION
Let’s compare the following compounds:
Which compound is more acidic? The only way to answer that question is to pull off
the protons and draw the conjugate bases:
Let’s go through the factors we learned so far. Factor 1 does not answer the
problem: in both cases, the negative charge is on oxygen. Factor 2 also does not answer
the problem: in both cases, there is resonance that delocalizes the charge over
two oxygen atoms. Now we need factor 3.
The difference between the compounds is clearly the placement of the chlorine
atoms. What effect will this have? For this, we need to understand a concept
called induction.
We know that electronegativity measures the affinity of an atom for electrons,
so what happens when you have two atoms of different electronegativity connected
to each other? For example, consider a carbon–oxygen bond (C–O). Oxygen is more
electronegative, so the two electrons that are shared between carbon and oxygen (the
two electrons that form the bond between them) are pulled more strongly by
the oxygen atom. This creates a difference in the electron density on the two
atoms—the oxygen atom becomes electron rich and the carbon atom becomes electron
poor. This is usually shown with the symbols d and d, which indicate “partial”
positive and “partial” negative charges:

3.3 FACTOR 3—INDUCTION 61
This “pulling” of electron density is called induction. Going back to our first example,
the three chlorine atoms withdraw electron density from the carbon atom to
which they are attached, rendering the carbon atom electron poor (d). This carbon
atom can then withdraw electron density from the region that has the negative charge,
and this effect will stabilize the negative charge:
Inductive effects fall off rapidly with distance, so there is a large difference between
the following structures:
Now we know the effect that electronegative atoms (N, O, Cl, Br, etc.) can
have if they are near a negative charge. It is a stabilizing effect. But what effect
do carbon atoms have (alkyl groups)? For example, is there a difference in acidity
between the following two compounds?
Yes, there is, because alkyl groups are electron donating. This is so because of a concept
called hyperconjugation, which we will not get into here; if you are interested,
you can look it up in your textbook. But the bottom-line, take-home message is that
alkyl groups are electron donating. So, what effect will this have on a negative
charge? If electron density is being given to an area where there is a negative charge,
then this area becomes less stable. It would be as if you are holding a hot potato, and
someone with a hot iron heats up your potato even more.
So the comparison goes like this:

and therefore,
EXERCISE 3.13 Compare the two protons highlighted below and determine which
one is more acidic.
Answer Begin by drawing the conjugate bases:
In the structure on the left, the charge is somewhat stabilized by the inductive effects
of the neighboring chlorine atoms. In contrast, the structure on the right is destabilized
by the presence of methyl groups. Therefore, the structure on the left is more
stable.
The more acidic proton is the one that will leave to give the more stable negative
charge. So the following proton is more acidic:

3.4 FACTOR 4—ORBITALS
The three factors we have learned so far will not explain the difference in acidity between
the two highlighted protons in the compound below:
In order to determine which proton is more acidic, we remove each proton and compare
the resulting conjugate bases:
In both cases, the negative charge is on a carbon, so factor 1 does not help. In both
cases, the charge is not stabilized by resonance, so factor 2 does not help. In both
cases, there are no inductive effects to consider, so factor 3 does not help. The answer
here comes from looking at the type of orbital that is accommodating the charge.
Let’s quickly review the shape of hybridized orbitals. sp3, sp2, and sp orbitals
all have roughly the same shape, but they are different in size:
Notice that the sp orbital is smaller and tighter than the other orbitals. It is closer to
the nucleus of the atom, which is located at the point where the front lobe (white)

meets the back lobe (gray). Therefore, a lone pair of electrons residing in an sp
orbital will be held closer to the positively charged nucleus and will be stabilized
by being close to the nucleus.
So a negative charge on an sp hybridized carbon is more stable than a negative
charge on an sp3 or sp2 hybridized carbon:
Determining which carbon atoms are sp, sp2, or sp3 is very simple: a carbon with
a triple bond is sp, a carbon with a double bond is sp2, and a carbon with all
single bonds is sp3. For more on this topic, turn to the next chapter (covering
geometry).
EXERCISE 3.17 Locate the most acidic proton in the following compound:
Answer It is important to recognize where all of the protons (hydrogen atoms)
are. If you cannot do this, then you should review Chapter 1, which covers bond-line
drawings. Only one proton can leave behind a negative charge in an sp orbital. All
of the other protons would leave behind a negative charge on either sp2 or sp3
hybridized orbitals. So the most acidic proton is
3.5 RANKING THE FOUR FACTORS
Now that we have seen each of the four factors individually, we need to consider
what order of importance to place them in. In other words, what should we look for
first? And what should we do if two factors are competing with each other?
In general, the order of importance is the order in which the factors were
presented in this chapter.
1. What atom is the charge on? (Remember the difference between comparing
atoms in the same row and comparing atoms in the same column.)
H
More stable
3.5 RANKING THE FOUR FACTORS 65
2. Are there any resonance effects making one conjugate base more stable
than the others?
3. Are there any inductive effects (electronegative atoms or alkyl groups) that
stabilize or destabilize any of the conjugate bases?
4. In what orbital do we find the negative charge for each conjugate base that
we are comparing?
There is an important exception to this order. Compare the following two
compounds:
In order to predict which compound is more acidic, we remove a proton from each
compound and compare the conjugate bases:
When comparing these two negative charges, we find two competing factors: the first
factor (what atom is the charge on?) and the fourth factor (what orbital is the charge
in?). The first factor says that a negative charge on nitrogen is more stable than a negative
charge on carbon. However, the fourth factor says that a negative charge in an
sp orbital is more stable than a negative charge in an sp3 orbital (the negative charge
on the nitrogen atom is an sp3 orbital). In general, we would say that factor 1 wins
over the others. But this case is an exception, and factor 4 (orbitals) actually wins
here, so the negative charge on carbon is more stable in this case:
This example illustrates that a negative charge on an sp hybridized carbon atom is
more stable than a negative charge on an sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom. For this reason,
NH2
 can be used as a base to deprotonate a triple bond.
There are, of course, other exceptions, but the one explained above is the most
common. In most cases, you should be able to apply the four factors and provide a
qualitative assessment of acidity.

66 CHAPTER 3 ACID–BASE REACTIONS
Answer The first thing we need to do is draw the conjugate bases:
Now we can compare them and ask which negative charge is more stable, using our
four factors:
1. Atom The first conjugate base has a negative charge on a nitrogen atom,
while the second conjugate base has a negative charge on a carbon atom.
Based on this factor alone, we predict that the first conjugate base should
be more stable.
2. Resonance Neither of the conjugate bases is stabilized by resonance.
3. Induction Neither of the conjugate bases is stabilized by induction.
4. Orbital The first conjugate base has a negative charge on an sp3 hybridized
atom, while the second conjugate base has a negative charge on an sp hybridized
atom. Based on this factor alone, we predict that the second conjugate
base should be more stable.
So, we have a competition between the first factor (atom) and the fourth factor
(orbital). In general, the first factor takes precedence over the fouth factor. But
this is the one exception that we saw. In this case, the fourth factor is the dominating
factor because a negative charge on an sp hybridized cabon atom is more
stable than a negative charge on an sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom. Therefore, the
proton highlighted below is the more acidic proton:
Remember the four factors, and what order they come in:
1. Atom
2. Resonance
3. Induction
4. Orbital

3.6 QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT
(pKa VALUES)
Everything we have mentioned so far has been the qualitative method for comparing
acidity of different protons. In other words, we never said how much more acidic
one proton is over another, and we never said exactly how acidic each proton is. We
have talked only about relative acidities: which proton is more acidic?
There is also a quantitative method of measuring acidities. All protons can
be given a number that quantifies exactly how acidic they are. This value is called
pKa. It is impossible to figure out the exact pKa by just looking at a structure. The
pKa must be determined empirically through experimentation. Many professors
require that you know some general pKa’s for certain classes of compounds (for
instance, all alcoholic protons, RO–H, will have the same ballpark pKa). Most
textbooks will have a chart that you can memorize. Your instructor will tell you
if you are expected to memorize this chart. Either way, you should know what the
numbers mean.
The smaller the pKa, the more acidic the proton is. This probably seems
strange, but that’s the way it is. A compound with a pKa of 4 is more acidic than a
compound with a pKa of 7. Next, we need to know what the difference is between
4 and 7. These numbers measure orders of magnitude. So the compound with a
pKa of 4 is 103 times more acidic (1000 times more acidic) than a compound with

a pKa of 7. If we compare a compound with a pKa of 10 to a compound with a pKa
of 25, we find that the first compound is 1015 times more acidic than the second
compound (1,000,000,000,000,000 times more acidic).
3.7 PREDICTING THE POSITION
OF EQUILIBRIUM
Now that we know how to compare stability of charge, we can begin to predict which
side of an equilibrium will be favored. Consider the following scenario:
This equilibrium represents the struggle between two bases competing for H.
A and B are competing with each other. Sometimes A gets the proton and
sometimes B gets the proton. If we have a very large amount of A and B and
not enough H to protonate both of them, then at any given moment in time, there
will be a certain number of A’s that have a proton (HA) and a certain number of
B’s that have a proton (HB). These numbers are controlled by the equilibrium,
which is controlled by (you guessed it) stability of the negative charges. If A is
more stable than B, then A will be happy to have the negative charge and B
will grab most of the protons. However, if B is more stable than A, then we
will have the reverse effect.
Another way of looking at this is the following. In the equilibrium above, we
see an A on one side and a B on the other side. The equilibrium will favor
whichever side has the more stable negative charge. If A is more stable, then the
equilibrium will lean so as to favor the formation of A:
If B is more stable, then the equilibrium will lean so as to favor the formation of B:
The position of equilibrium can be easily predicted by comparing the relative stability
of negative charges.
EXERCISE 3.34 Predict the position of equilibrium for the following reaction:
Answer We look at both sides of the equilibrium and compare the negative charge

H A + B A + H B
H A + B A + H B
H A + B A + H B

1. Atom The negative charge on the left is on oxygen, and negative charge
on the right is also on oxygen. So this factor does not help us.
2. Resonance Neither one is resonance stabilized.
3. Induction The negative charge on the left is destabilized by an electrondonating
alkyl group. The one on the right is not destabilized in this way.
4. Orbital No difference between the right and left.
Based on factor 3, we conclude that the one on the right is more stable, and therefore
the equilibrium lies to the right. We show this in the following way:

3.8 SHOWING A MECHANISM
Later on in the course, you will spend a lot of time drawing mechanisms of reactions.
A mechanism shows how the electrons move during a reaction to form the products.
Sometimes many steps are required, and sometimes only one step is required. In
acid–base reactions, mechanisms are very straightforward because there is only one
step. We use curved arrows (just like we did when drawing resonance structures) to
show how the electrons flow. The only difference is that here we are allowed to break
single bonds, because we are using arrows to show how a reaction happened (a reaction
that involved the breaking of a single bond). With resonance drawings, we

can never break a single bond (remember the first commandment). The second
commandment—never violate the octet rule—is still true, even when we are drawing
mechanisms. Second-row elements can never have more than four bonds, as described
in Section 2.3.
From an arrow-pushing point of view, all acid–base reactions are the same. It
goes like this:
There are always two arrows. One is drawn coming from the base and grabbing the
proton. The second arrow is drawn coming from the bond (between the proton and
whatever atom is connected to the proton) and going to the atom currently connected
to the proton. That’s it. There are always two arrows. Each arrow has a head and a
tail, so there are four possible mistakes you can make. You might accidentally draw
either of the heads incorrectly, or you might draw either of the tails incorrectly. With
a little bit of practice you will see just how easy it is, and you will realize that
acid–base reactions always follow the same mechanism.

the bond (that is losing the proton) to the atom (currently connected to the proton):

3.8 SHOWING A MECHANISM 73
In this chapter, we will see how to predict the 3D shape of molecules. This is important
because it limits much of the reactivity that you will see in the second half of
this course. For molecules to react with each other, the reactive parts of the molecules
must be able to get close in space. If the geometry of the molecules prevents them
from getting close, then there cannot be a reaction. This concept is called sterics.
Let’s use an analogy to help us see the importance of geometry. Imagine that
you are stuffing a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner and your hand gets stuck inside
the turkey. Just at that moment, someone wants to shake your hand. You can’t shake
the person’s hand because your hand is unavailable at the moment. It’s kind of the
same way with molecules. When two molecules react with each other, there are specific
sites on the molecules that are reacting with each other. If those sites cannot get
close to each other, the reaction won’t happen.
There will be many times in the second half of this course when you will
be trying to determine which way a reaction will proceed from two possible
outcomes. Many times, you will choose one outcome, because the other outcome
has steric problems to overcome (the geometry of the molecules does not permit
the reactive sites to get close together). In fact, you will learn to make decisions
like this as soon as you learn your first reactions: SN2 versus SN1 reactions. Now
that we know why geometry is so important, we need to brush up on some basic
concepts.
To determine the geometry of an entire molecule, we need to be able to determine
the geometry of each atom. This is accomplished by analyzing how it is connected
to the atoms around it. After all, that is what defines the geometry—how the
atoms are connected in 3D space. Since atoms are connected to each other with
bonds, it makes sense that we need to take a close look at bonds. In particular, we
need to know the exact locations and angles of every bond to every atom. This might
sound difficult, but it is actually straightforward, and with a little bit of practice, you
can get to the point where you know the geometry of a molecule as soon as you look
at it (without even needing to think about it). That is the point that we need to get to,
and that is what this chapter is all about.
4.1 ORBITALS AND HYBRIDIZATION STATES
To determine the geometry of a molecule, we need to know how atoms bond with
each other three dimensionally, so it makes sense for our discussion to start with orbitals.
After all, bonds come from overlapping atomic orbitals.
74
CHAPTER 4
GEOMETRY
4.1 ORBITALS AND HYBRIDIZATION STATES 75
A bond is formed when an electron of one atom overlaps with an electron of
another atom. The two electrons are shared between both atoms, and we call that a
bond. Since electrons exist in regions of space called orbitals, then what we really
need to know is; what are the locations and angles of the atomic orbitals around every
atom? It is not so complicated, because the number of possible arrangements of
atomic orbitals is very small. You need to learn the possibilities, and how to identify
them when you see them. So, we need to talk about orbitals.
There are two simple atomic orbitals: s and p orbitals (we don’t really deal
with d and f orbitals in organic chemistry). s orbitals are spherical and p orbitals have
two lobes (one front lobe and one back lobe):
Atoms in the second row (such as C, N, O, and F) have one s orbital and three p
orbitals in the valence shell. These orbitals are usually mixed together to give us hybridized
orbitals (sp3, sp2, and sp). We get these orbitals by mixing the properties of
s and p orbitals. What do we mean by mixing?
Imagine one swimming pool shaped like a triangle and another shaped like a
pentagon; now we put them next to each other. We wave a magic wand and they
magically turn into two rectangular pools. That would be a neat trick. That’s what sp
orbitals are: we take one s orbital and one p orbital, then wave a magic wand, and
poof—we now have two equivalent orbitals that look the same. The two new orbitals
have a different shape from the original two orbitals. This new shape is somewhat of
an average of the two original shapes.
If we mix two p orbitals and one s orbital, then we get three equivalent sp2
orbitals. Let’s go back to the pool analogy. Imagine two pools shaped like octagons
and one shaped like a triangle. We wave our magic wand and get three pools
shaped like hexagons. We started with three pools and we ended with three pools.
But the three pools in the end all look the same. The same thing is true here with
orbitals. We start with three orbitals (two p orbitals and one s orbital). Then we
mix them together and end up with three orbitals that all look the same. The three
new orbitals (since they came from one s orbital and two p orbitals) are called sp2
orbitals. Similarly, when you combine three p orbitals and one s orbital, you get
four equivalent sp3 orbitals.
To truly understand the geometry of bonds, we need to understand the geometry
of these three different hybridization states. The hybridization state of an atom
describes the type of hybridized atomic orbitals (sp3, sp2, or sp) that contain the
valence electrons. Each hybridized orbital can be used either to form a bond with
another atom or to hold a lone pair.
It is not difficult to determine hybridization states. If you can add, then you
should have no trouble determining the hybridization state of an atom. Just count
s orbital p orbital
how many other atoms are bonded to your atom, and count how many lone pairs
your atom has. Add these numbers. Now you have the total number of hybridized orbitals
that contain the valence electrons. This number is all you need to determine
the hybridization state of the atom. Let’s look at an example to clear it up.
Consider the molecule below:
Let’s try to determine the hybridization state of the carbon atom in the center. We
begin by counting the number of atoms connected to this carbon atom. There are 3
atoms (O, H, and H). The oxygen atom only counts as one.
Next we count the number of lone pairs on the carbon atom. There are no lone
pairs on the carbon atom. (If you are not sure how to tell that there are no lone pairs
there, go back to Chapter 1 and review the section on counting lone pairs.) Now
we take the sum of the attached atoms and the number of lone pairs—in this case,
3  0  3. Therefore, three hybridized orbitals are being used here. That means that
we have mixed two p orbitals and one s orbital (a total of three orbitals) to get three
equivalent sp2 orbitals. Thus, the hybridization is sp2. Let’s take a closer look at how
this works.
Recall that the second row elements have three p orbitals and one s orbital that
can be hybridized in one of three ways: sp3, sp2, or sp. If we are using three hybridized
orbitals, then we must have mixed two p orbitals with one s orbital:
So here’s the rule: Just add the number of bonded atoms to the number of lone pairs.
The number you get tells you how many hybridized orbitals you need according to
the following:
If the sum is 4, then you have 4 sp3 orbitals.
If the sum is 3, then you have 3 sp2 orbitals and one p orbital (as in our
example).
If the sum is 2, then you have 2 sp orbitals and two p orbitals.

76 CHAPTER 4 GEOMETRY
There are several exceptions. For now, don’t worry. We will focus on simple cases.
Once you get used to looking at drawings of molecules, you should not have
to count anymore. There are certain arrangements that are always sp3 hybridized,
and the same is true for sp2 and sp. Here are some common examples:
If you can determine the hybridization state of any atom, you will be able to easily
determine the geometry of that atom. Let’s do another example.
EXERCISE 4.1 Identify the hybridization state for the nitrogen atom in ammonia
(NH3).
Answer First we need to ask how many atoms are connected to this nitrogen
atom. There are three hydrogen atoms. Next we need to ask how many lone pairs the
nitrogen atom has. It has 1 lone pair. Now, we take the sum. 3  1  4. If we need
to have four hybridized orbitals, then the hybridization state must be sp3.

4.8 For each carbon atom in the following molecule, identify the hybridization
state. Do not forget to count the hydrogen atoms (they are not shown). Use the
following simple method: A carbon with 4 single bonds is sp3 hybridized. A carbon
with a double bond is sp2 hybridized, and a carbon with a triple bond is sp
hybridized.
Once you get used to it, you do not need to count anymore—just look at the number
of bonds. If carbon has only single bonds, then it is sp3 hybridized. If the carbon
atom has a double bond, then it is sp2 hybridized. If the carbon atom has a triple bond,
then it is sp hybridized. Consult the chart of common examples on the previous page.
4.2 GEOMETRY
Now that we know how to determine hybridization states, we need to know the
geometry of each of the three hybridization states. One simple theory explains it all.
This theory is called the valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR).
Stated simply, all orbitals containing electrons in the outermost shell (the valence
shell) want to get as far apart from each other as possible. This one simple idea is all
you need to predict the geometry around an atom. First, let’s apply the theory to the
three types of hybridized orbitals.
1. Four equivalent sp3-hybridized orbitals achieve maximum distance from
one another when they arrange in a tetrahedral structure:
Think of this as a tripod with an additional leg sticking straight up in the air. In
this arrangement, each of the four orbitals is exactly 109.5° from each of the other
three orbitals.
2. Three equivalent sp2-hybridized orbitals achieve maximum distance from
one another when they arrange in a trigonal planar structure:
sp2
O
78 CHAPTER 4 GEOMETRY
4.2 GEOMETRY 79
All three orbitals are in the same plane, and each one is 120° from each of the other
orbitals. The remaining p orbital is orthogonal to (perpendicular to the plane of) the
three hybridized orbitals.
3. Two equivalent sp-hybridized orbitals achieve maximum distance from one
another when they arrange in a linear structure:
Both orbitals are 180° from each other. The remaining two p orbitals are 90° from
each other and from each of the hybridized orbitals.
So far its very simple:
1. sp3  tetrahedral
2. sp2  trigonal planar
3. sp  linear
But here’s where students usually get confused. What happens when a hybridized
orbital holds a lone pair? What does that do to the geometry? The answer is that
the geometry of the orbitals does not change, but the geometry of the molecule is
affected. Why?
Let’s look at an example. In ammonia (NH3), the nitrogen atom is sp3 hybridized,
so all four orbitals arrange in a tetrahedral structure, just as we would expect.
But only three of the orbitals in this arrangement are responsible for bonds. So,
if we look just at the atoms that are connected, we do not see a tetrahedron. Rather,
we see a trigonal pyramidal arrangement:
Trigonal, because there are three bonds pointing away from the central nitrogen
atom, and pyramidal because it’s shaped like a pyramid.
Similarly, in H2O, the oxygen atom is sp3 hybridized. So all four orbitals
are in a tetrahedral arrangement, just as we would expect for an sp3 hybridized
atom. But only two of the orbitals are being used for bonds. So if we look just
at the atoms that are connected, we do not see a tetrahedron. Rather, we see a
bent arrangement:
H
H H
N
N
H H
H
Let’s now put all of this information together:
sp3 with 0 lone pairs  tetrahedral
sp3 with 1 lone pair  trigonal pyramidal
sp3 with 2 lone pairs  bent
sp2 with 0 lone pairs  trigonal planar
sp2 with 1 lone pair  bent
sp with 0 lone pairs  linear
That’s it. There are only six different types of geometry that we need to know. First
we determine the hybridization state. Then, using the number of lone pairs, we can
figure out which of the six different types of geometry we are dealing with. Let’s try
it out on a problem.
EXERCISE 4.9 Identify the geometry of the carbon atom below:
Answer First, we need to determine the hybridization state. We did this for this
molecule earlier in this chapter and found that the hybridization state is sp2 (there are
3 atoms connected and no lone pairs, so we need three hybridized orbitals; therefore,
it is sp2).
Next we remind ourselves how many lone pairs there are; in this case, there
are none. So the geometry must be trigonal planar.
Once you can determine the geometry around an atom, you should have no
problem determining the geometry, or shape, of a molecule. Simply repeat your
analysis for each and every atom in the molecule. This may seem like a large task at
first, but once you get the hang of it, you will be able to determine the geometry of
an atom immediately upon seeing it.
For the next set of problems, you should get to the point where you can do
these problems very quickly. The first few will take you longer than the last ones.
If the last problem is still taking you a long time, then you have not mastered the
process and you will need more practice. If this is the case, open to any page in the
second half of your textbook. You will probably see drawings of structures. Point

to any atom in a structure and try to determine what the geometry is. Use the list
above to help you. Go from one drawing to the next until you can do it without the
list. That is the important part—doing it without needing the list.
PROBLEMS Identify the hybridization state and geometry of each atom in the following
compounds. Do not worry about the geometry of atoms connected to only one
other atom. For example, do not worry about the geometry of any hydrogen atoms or
about the geometry of the oxygen atoms in problems 4.12, 4.13, 4.15, and 4.17.

on the nitrogen atom in the following compound:
N
O
O
N
O
N
O
O
4.3 LONE PAIRS 81
This nitrogen atom has three bonds and one lone pair, so it is sp3 hybridized, just
as we would expect. The lone pair occupies an sp3 hybridized orbital, and the nitrogen
atom has trigonal pyramidal geometry, just as we saw in the previous section. But now
consider the nitrogen atom in the following compound:
The lone pair on this nitrogen atom does NOT occupy a hybridized orbital.
Why not? Because this lone pair is participating in resonance:
Inspection of the second resonance structure reveals that this nitrogen atom is
actually sp2 hybridized, not sp3. It might look like it is sp3 hybridized in the first
resonance structure, but it isn’t. Here is the general rule: a lone pair that participates
in resonance must occupy a p orbital. In other words, the nitrogen atom in the compound
above is sp2 hybridized. And as a result, this nitrogen atom is trigonal planar
rather than trigonal pyramidal.
Now let’s get some practice identifying atoms that possess a lone pair participating
in resonance:

All molecules have names, and we need to know their names to communicate. Consider
the molecule below:
Clearly, it would be inadequate to refer to this compound as “you know, that
thing with five carbons and an OH coming off the side with a chlorine on a double
bond.” First of all, there are too many other compounds that fit that fuzzy description.
And even if we could come up with a very adequate description that could only
be this one compound, it would take way too long (probably an entire paragraph) to
describe. By following the rules of nomenclature, we can unambiguously describe
this molecule with just a few letters and numbers: Z-2-chloropent-2-en-1-ol.
It would be impossible to memorize the names of every molecule, because
there are too many to even count. Instead, we have a very systematic way of naming
molecules. What you need to learn are the rules for naming molecules (these
rules are referred to as IUPAC nomenclature). This is a much more manageable task
than memorizing names, but even these rules can become challenging to master.
There are so many of them, that you could study only these rules for an entire
semester and still not finish all of them. The larger the molecules get, the more rules
you need to account for every kind of possibility. In fact, the list of rules is regularly
updated and refined.
Fortunately, you do not need to learn all of these rules, because we deal with
very simple molecules in this course. You need to learn only the rules that allow you
to name small molecules. This chapter focuses on most of the rules you need to name
simple molecules.
There are five parts to every name:
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
1. Stereoisomerism indicates whether double bonds are cis/trans, and indicates
stereocenters (R, S), which we will cover in the chapter on configuration.
2. Substituents are groups coming off of the main chain.
3. Parent is the main chain.

Let’s use the compound above as an example:

Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation group
(Z) 2-chloro pent 2-en 1-ol
We will systematically go through all five parts to every name, starting at the end
(functional group) and working our way backward to the first part of the name
(stereoisomerism). It is important to do it backward like this, because the position of
the functional group affects which parent chain you choose.
5.1 FUNCTIONAL GROUP
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
The term functional group refers to specific arrangements of atoms that have certain
characteristics for reactivity. For example, when an –OH is connected to a
compound, we call the molecule an alcohol. Alcohols will display similar reactivity,
because alcohols all have the same functional group, the –OH group. In
fact, most textbooks have chapters arranged according to functional groups (one
chapter on alcohols, one chapter on amines, etc.). Accordingly, many textbooks
treat nomenclature as an ongoing learning process: As you work through the
course, you slowly add to your list of functional group names. Here we focus on
six common functional groups, because you will certainly learn at least these six
throughout your course.
When a compound has one of these six groups, we show it in the name of the
compound by adding a suffix to the name:
Functional group Class of compound Suffix
Carboxylic acid -oic acid
Ester -oate
R OH
O
R OR
O
(continued)
Functional group Class of compound Suffix
Aldehyde -al
Ketone -one
Alcohol -ol
Amine -amine
Halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) are usually not named in the suffix of a compound. They get
named as substituents, which we will see later on.
Notice that the carboxylic acid is like a ketone and an alcohol placed next to
each other. But be careful, because carboxylic acids are very different from ketones
or alcohols. So don’t make the mistake of thinking that a carboxylic acid is a ketone
and an alcohol:
The second compound above raises an important issue: how do you name the
functional group when you have two functional groups in a compound? One will
go in the suffix of the name and the other will be a prefix in the substituent part of
the name. But how do we choose which one goes as the suffix of the name? There
is a hierarchy that needs to be followed. The six groups shown above are listed according
to their hierarchy, so a carboxylic acid takes precedence over an alcohol.
A compound with both of these groups is named as a ketone and we put the term
“hydroxy” in the substituent part of the name.

Answer There are two functional groups in this compound, so we have to decide
between calling this compound an amine or calling it an alcohol. If we look at the
hierarchy above, we see that an alcohol outranks an amine. Therefore, we use
the suffix -ol in naming this compound.

5.2 UNSATURATION
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
Many compounds have double or triple bonds, and are said to be “unsaturated” because
a compound with a double or triple bond has less hydrogen than it would have
without the double or triple bond. These double and triple bonds are very easy to see
in bond-line drawings:
Triple bond Double bond
OH
pentanol pentane
The presence of a double bond or triple bond is indicated in the following way,
where “en” (pronounced een) represents a double bond, and “yn” (pronounced ine)
represents a triple bond:
Notice that “an” is used to indicate the absence of a double bond or triple bond, such as
in “pentane” above. If there are two double bonds in a compound, then the unsaturation
is “-dien-.” Three double bonds is “-trien-.” Similarly, two triple bonds is “-diyn-,”
and three triple bonds is “-triyn-.” For multiple double and triple bonds, we use the
following terms:
di  2 penta  5
tri 3 hexa 6
tetra  4
You will rarely ever see this many double or triple bonds in one compound, but it is
possible to see both double and triple bonds in the same compound. For example,
The compound shown here has three double bonds and two triple bonds. So it is a
triendiyne. Double bonds always get listed first.
EXERCISE 5.11 Identify how you would describe the unsaturation in the name of
the following compound:
Answer This compound has one double bond and one triple bond. For the double
bond, we use the term “en.” For the triple bond, we use the term “yn.” Double bonds
get listed first, so this compound is –enyn-.

5.3 NAMING THE PARENT CHAIN
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
When naming the parent of the compound, we are looking for the chain of carbon
atoms that is going to be the root of our name. Everything else in the compound is
connected to that chain at a specific location, designated by numbers. So we need to
know how to choose the parent carbon chain and how to number it correctly.
The first step is learning how to say “a chain of three carbon atoms” or “a chain
of seven carbon atoms.” Here is a table showing the appropriate names:
Number of carbon
atoms in the chain Parent
1 meth
2 eth
3 prop
4 but
5 pent
6 hex
7 hept
8 oct
9 non
10 dec
If we have carbon atoms in a ring, we add the term cyclo, so a ring of six carbon atoms
is called cyclohex- as the parent and a ring of five carbon atoms is cyclopent-.
You must commit these terms to memory. I am not a big advocate of memorization,
but for now, you must memorize these terms. After a while, it will become
habitual, like a phone number that you dial all of the time, and you won’t have to
think about it anymore.
The tricky part comes when you need to figure out which carbon chain to use.
Consider the following example, which has three different possibilities for the parent
chain:
So how do we know whether to call this –but- (which is 4) or –pent- (which is 5) or
–hex- (which is 6)? There is a hierarchy for this as well. The chain should be as long
as possible, making sure to include the following groups, in this order:
Functional group
Double bond
Triple bond
OH OH OH
4-carbon chain 5-carbon chain 6-carbon chain
First we need to find the functional group and make sure that the functional group is
connected directly to the parent chain. Remember from the last section that if there are
two functional groups, one of them gets priority. The functional group that gets priority
is the one that needs to be connected to our parent chain. Of the three possibilities
shown above, this rule eliminates the last possibility, because the functional group
(OH) is not connected directly to the parent chain.
If there are still more choices of possible parent chains (as there are in this
case), then we look for the chain that also includes the double bond (if there is one
in the compound). In our case, there is a double bond, and this rule determines for
us which chain to use:
Of the remaining two possibilities, we must choose a parent that includes both carbon
atoms of the double bond. Only one parent chain contains both the functional
group and the two carbon atoms of the double bond. “Containing the functional
group” means that the OH is connected to a carbon that is part of the chain. We do
not count the oxygen atom itself as part of the chain. It is only attached to the chain.
So the chain above is made up of four carbon atoms.
In cases where there is no functional group, then we look for the longest chain
that includes the double bond. If there is no double bond, then we look for a triple
bond, and choose the longest chain that has the triple bond in it.
If there are no functional groups, no double bonds, and no triple bonds, then
we simply choose the longest chain possible.
Now you can see why we are moving our way backward through the naming
process. We cannot name the parent correctly unless we can pick out the highest
ranking functional group in the compound. So we start naming a compound by first
asking which functional group has priority.
EXERCISE 5.18 Name the parent chain in the following compound:
Answer First we look for a functional group. This compound is a carboxylic acid,
so we know the parent chain must include the carboxylic acid group. Next we look
for a double bond. The parent chain should include that as well. This gives us our
answer. The triple bond will not be included in the parent chain, because the functional
group and the double bond are a higher priority than a triple bond.

So we count the number of carbon atoms in this chain. There are six (notice that
we include the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid group). Therefore, the parent
will be called “hex.”

5.4 NAMING SUBSTITUENTS
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
Once we have identified the functional group and the parent chain, then everything
else connected to the parent chain is called a substituent. In the following example,
all of the highlighted groups are substituents, because they are not part of the
parent chain:
We start by learning how to name the alkyl substituents. These groups are
named with the same terminology that we used for naming parent chains, but we add
“yl” to the end to indicate that it is a substituent:
Number of carbon atoms
in the substituent Substituent
1 methyl
2 ethyl
3 propyl
4 butyl
5 pentyl
6 hexyl
7 heptyl
8 octyl
9 nonyl
10 decyl
Methyl groups can be shown in a number of ways, and all of them are acceptable:
Ethyl groups can also be shown in a number of ways:
Propyl groups are usually just drawn, but sometimes you will see the term Pr (which
stands for propyl):
Look at the propyl group above and you will notice that it is a small chain of 3 carbon
atoms that is attached to the parent chain by the first carbon of the small chain.
But what if it is attached by the middle carbon? Then it is not called propyl anymore:

5.4 NAMING SUBSTITUENTS 91
92 CHAPTER 5 NOMENCLATURE
It is still a chain of three carbon atoms, but it is attached to the parent chain differently
than a propyl group is attached, so we call it isopropyl. This is an example of
a branched substituent (branched, because it is not connected in one straight line to
the parent chain, like a propyl group is).
Another important branched substituent to be familiar with is the tert-butyl
group:
The tert-butyl group is made up of four carbon atoms, just like a butyl group, but
the tert-butyl group is not a straight line connected to the parent. Rather, the group
has three methyl groups attached to one carbon atom, which is itself attached to the
parent chain. So, we call this group tert-butyl.
There are two other ways to attach four carbon atoms to a parent chain (other
than butyl and tert-butyl). As a small assignment, see if you can find their names in
your textbook.
There is another important type of substituent that we need to consider. When
we learned about functional groups, we saw that some compounds can have two
functional groups. When this happens, we choose one of the functional groups to be
named as the suffix, and the other functional group must be named as a substituent.
To choose the functional group that gets the priority, go back to the section on functional
groups and you will see the list of functional groups. We need to know how to
name these functional groups as substituents. The OH group is named –hydroxy- as
a substituent. The NH2 group is called –amino- if it is named as a substituent. A
ketone is called –keto- as a substituent, and an aldehyde is called –aldo- as a substituent.
Knowing how to name those four functional groups as substituents will
probably cover you for anything you will see in your course.
Halogens are named as substituents in the following way: fluoro, chloro,
bromo, and iodo. Essentially, we add the letter “o” at the end to say that they are substituents.
If there are multiple substituents of the same kind (for example, if there are
five chlorine atoms in the compound), we use the same prefixes that we used earlier
when classifying the number of double and triple bonds:
di  2 penta  5
tri 3 hexa 6
tetra  4
So a compound with five chlorine atoms would be “pentachloro.” Each and every
substituent needs to be numbered so that we know where it goes on the parent chain,
but we will learn about this after we have finished going through the five parts of
the name. At that time, we will also discuss in what order to place substituents in
the name.
butyl tert-butyl
EXERCISE 5.28 In the following compound, identify all groups that would
be considered substituents, and then indicate how you would name each
substituent:
Answer First we must locate the functional group that gets the priority. Alcohols
outrank amines, so the OH group is the priority functional group. Then, we need to
locate the parent chain. There are no double or triple bonds, so we choose the longest
chain containing the OH group:
Now we know which groups must be substituents, and we name them accordingly:

5.5 STEREOISOMERISM
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
Stereoisomerism is the first part of every name. It identifies the configuration of any
double bonds or stereocenters. If there are no double bonds or stereocenters in the molecule,
then you don’t need to worry about this part of the name. If there are, you must
learn how to identify the configuration of each. Identifying the configuration of a stereocenter
requires a chapter to itself. You will need to learn what a stereocenter is, how
to locate them in molecules, how to draw them, and how to assign a configuration
(R or S). These topics will all be covered in detail in Chapter 7. At that time, we will
revisit how to appropriately identify the configuration in the name of the molecule. For
now, you should know that configurations are placed here in the first part of a name.
Here we will focus on double bonds, which can often be arranged in two ways:
This is very different from the case with single bonds, which are freely rotating all of
the time. But a double bond is the result of overlapping p orbitals, and double bonds
cannot freely rotate at room temperature (if you had trouble with this concept when
you first learned it, you should review the bonding structure of a double bond in your
textbook or notes). So there are two ways to arrange the atoms in space: cis and trans.
If you compare which atoms are connected to each other in each of the two possibilities,
you will notice that all of the atoms are connected in the same order. The
difference is how they are connected in 3D space. This is why they are called
stereoisomers (this type of isomerism stems from a difference of orientation in
space—“stereo”).
To name a double bond as being cis or trans, you need to have identical groups
on either side of the double bond that can be compared to each other. If these
cis trans

OH

I

identical groups are on the same side of the double bond, we call them cis. If they
are on opposite sides, we call them trans:
The two groups that we compare can even be hydrogen atoms. For example,
But what do you do if you don’t have two identical groups to compare? For
example,
These compounds are clearly not the same. We cannot use cis/trans terminology to
differentiate them, because we don’t have two identical groups to compare. In situations
when all four groups on the double bond are different, we have to use another
method for naming them.
The other way of naming double bonds uses rules similar to those used in determining
the configuration of a stereocenter (R versus S), so we will wait until the
next chapter (when we learn about R and S), and then we will cover this alternative
way of naming double bonds. The alternative method is far superior, because it can
be used to name any double bond. In contrast, cis/trans nomenclature can be used
only when we have two identical groups. The reason that we do not drop the cis/
trans terminology altogether is probably based in deep-rooted tradition and usage
of these terms.
There is one situation when we don’t have to worry about cis/trans because
there aren’t two ways to arrange the double bond. If we have two identical groups
connected to the same atom, then we cannot have stereoisomers. For example,
because there are two chlorine atoms connected to one carbon atom on one side of
the double bond. Why are the two drawings the same? Remember that the carbon
atoms of the double bond are sp2 hybridized, and therefore trigonal planar. So, if we

flip over the first drawing, we get the other drawing. They are the same thing. To see
this, take two pieces of paper. Draw one of these compounds on one piece of paper,
and draw the other compound on the second piece of paper. Then flip over one of the
pieces of paper, and hold it up to the light so that you can see the drawing through
the back side of the paper. Compare it to the other drawing and you will see that they
are the same. If you try to do the same thing with some of the previous examples
(that did have cis and trans stereoisomers), you will find that flipping the page over
does not make the two drawings the same. This is a useful exercise, so take a few
minutes and do it.
EXERCISE 5.39 Determine whether the double bond below is cis or trans:
Answer Begin by circling the four groups attached to the double bond and try to
name them:
You should always use this technique, because it will help you see when you have
two groups that are the same. There are always four groups on the double bond (even
if some of them are just hydrogen atoms). In this case, it helps us see that there are
two isopropyl groups on the same side of the double bond. Therefore, the double
bond is cis.

5.6 NUMBERING
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
Numbering applies to all parts of the name
We’re almost ready to start naming molecules. We finished learning about the individual
parts of a name, and now we need to know how to identify how the pieces are
connected. For example, let’s say you determine that the functional group is OH
(therefore, the suffix is –ol), there is one double bond (-en-), the parent chain is six
carbon atoms long (hex), there are four methyl groups attached to the parent chain
(tetramethyl), and the double bond is cis. Now you know all of the pieces, but we
must find a way to identify where all of the pieces are on the parent chain. Where
are all of those methyl groups? (and so on). This is where the numbering system
comes in. First we will learn how to number the parent chain, and then we will learn
the rules of how to apply those numbers in each part of the name.
Once we have chosen the parent chain, there are only two ways to number it:
right to left or left to right. But how do we choose? To number the parent chain properly,
we begin with the same hierarchy that we used when choosing the parent in the
first place:
Functional group
Double bond
Triple bond
If there is a functional group, then number the parent chain so that the functional
group gets the lower number:
If there is no functional group, then number the chain so that the double bond gets
the lower number:
If there is no functional group or double bond, then number the chain so that the
triple bond gets the lower number:
1
2

If there is no functional group, double bond, or triple bond, then we should number
the chain so that the substituent has the lower number:
If there is more than one substituent on the parent chain, then we should number the
chain so that the substituents get the lowest numbers possible:
EXERCISE 5.46 For the compound below, choose the parent chain and then number
it correctly:
Answer To choose the parent chain, remember that we need to choose the longest
chain that contains the functional group:
To number it correctly, we need to go in the direction that gives the functional group
the lowest number:

it correctly.

5.47 5.48 5.49
Now that we know how to number the parent chain, we need to see how to apply
those numbers to the various parts of the name.
Functional Group The number generally gets placed directly in front of the
suffix (for example, hexan-2-ol). If the functional group appears at the number 1,
then the number does not need to be placed in the name (for example, hexanol). It is
assumed that the absence of a number means that the functional group is at the number
1 position. When placing a number, it is OK to place the number at the beginning
of the parent. For example, 2-hexanol is the same as hexan-2-ol. Both names
are acceptable.
Unsaturation For double and triple bonds, the number indicates the lower
number of the two carbon atoms. For example,
The double bond is between C2 and C3, so we use C2 to number the double bond. So
the example above is hex-2-ene (or 2-hexene). We treat triple bonds the same way.
If there are two double bonds in the molecule, then we must indicate both
numbers; for example, hexa-2,4-diene, or 2,4-hexadiene. Every double and triple
bond must be numbered.
Substituents The number of the substituent goes immediately in front of the
substituent. Examples:
If there are multiple substituents, then every substituent must be numbered:
Cl
Cl
2,3-dichlorohexane 2,2,4-trimethylpentane

2-chlorohexane 3-methylpentane

5.6 NUMBERING 99
100 CHAPTER 5 NOMENCLATURE
If there are multiple substituents of different types, then we must alphabetize the
substituents in the name. Consider the following example:
There are four types of substituents in the example above (chloro, fluoro, ethyl, and
methyl). They must be alphabetized (c, e, f, m) (we do not count di, tri, tetra, etc. as
part of the alphabetization system). So the compound above is called
2-chloro-3-ethyl-2,4-difluoro-4-methylnonane
Note that two numbers are always separated by commas (2,4 in example above) but
letters and numbers are separated by dashes (2-chloro-3-ethyl . . .).
Stereoisomerism If there are any double bonds, we place the term cis or trans
at the beginning of the name. If there is more than one double bond, then we need
to indicate cis or trans for each double bond, and we must number accordingly (for
example, 2-cis-4-trans . . .). If there are any stereocenters, here is where we would
indicate them; for example, (2R,4S). Stereocenters are placed in parentheses. We
will see more of this when we learn about stereocenters in the upcoming chapters.
There it is. A lot of rules. No one ever said nomenclature would take 10 minutes
to learn, but with enough practice, you should get the hang of it. Let’s now take
everything we have learned and practice naming compounds:
EXERCISE 5.56 Name the following compound:
Answer We go through the five parts of the name backward. So we start by looking
for the functional group. We see that this compound is a ketone. So we know the
end of the name will be –one.
Next, we look for unsaturation. There is a double bond here, so there will
be –en- in the name.
Next we need to name the parent. We locate the longest chain that includes the
functional group and double bond. In this example, it is an obvious choice. The parent
has 7 carbon atoms, so the parent is –hept-.
Next we look for substituents. There are two methyl groups and two chlorine
atoms. We need to alphabetize, and c comes before m, so it will be dichlorodimethyl.
Next we look for stereoisomerism. The double bond in this molecule has two
chlorine atoms on opposite sides, so it is trans. This part of the name (trans) is generally
italicized and surrounded by parentheses. So far, we have
(trans)-dichlorodimethylheptenone
O Cl
Cl
Cl F F CH3
Now that we have figured out all of the pieces, we must assign numbers. We need to
number the parent to give the functional group the lowest number, so the numbering,
in this example, will go from left to right. This puts the functional group at the number
2 position, the double bond at the 4 position, the chlorine atoms at 4 and 5, and
the methyl groups at 6 (both of them). So the name is
(trans)-4,5-dichloro-6,6-dimethylhept-4-en-2-one

now. We will focus on stereocenters in the upcoming chapters.)

5.7 COMMON NAMES
In addition to the rules for naming compounds, there are also some common names
for some simple and common organic compounds. You should be aware of these
names to the extent that your course demands this of you. Each course will be
different in terms of how many of these common names you should be familiar with.
Here are some examples:
H

IUPAC Name = methanoic acid
Common Name = formic acid
IUPAC Name = ethanoic acid
Common Name = acetic acid
Cl Me
F Me
OH
O OH
NH2
Most of these examples are so common that it is quite rare to hear someone refer to
these compounds by their IUPAC names. Their common names are much more
“common,” which is why we call them common names.
Ethers are typically called by their common names. The group on either side
of the oxygen atom is named as a substituent before the term ether. Examples:
The IUPAC method would be to treat the oxygen atom like a carbon atom and then
indicate where the oxygen atom is with the term oxa-. So diethyl ether would be 3-
oxapentane, but no one calls it that. Everyone calls it diethyl ether (or even just ethyl
ether). It is not a bad idea to familiarize yourself with all of the common names listed
in whatever textbook you are using.
5.8 GOING FROM A NAME
TO A STRUCTURE
Once you have completed all of the problems in this chapter, you will find that it
is much easier to draw a compound when you are given the name than it is to name
a compound that is drawn in front of you. It is easier for the following reason:
when naming a compound, there are a lot of decisions you need to make (which
functional group has priority, what is the parent chain, how the chain should be
numbered, in what order to put the substituents in the name, etc.). But when you
have a name in front of you and you need to draw a structure, you do not need to
make any of these decisions. Just draw the parent and then start adding everything
else to it according to the numbering system provided in the name.
For practice, make a list of the answers to problems 5.57–5.66. This list should
just be names. Wait a few days until you cannot remember what the structures looked
like and then try to draw them based on the names. You can also use your textbook
for more examples.
From this point on, I will assume that I can say names like 2-hexanol and you
will know what I mean. That is what your textbook will do as well, so now is the
time to master nomenclature.

5.8 GOING FROM A NAME TO A STRUCTURE 103
Molecules are not inanimate objects. Unlike rocks, they can twist and bend into all
kinds of shapes, very much like people do. We have limbs and joints (elbows, knees,
etc.) that give us flexibility. Although our bones might be very rigid, nevertheless,
we can achieve a great range of movement by twisting our joints in different ways.
Molecules behave the same way. Once you learn about the general types of joints
that molecules have and the ranges of motion available to those joints, you will then
be able to predict how individual molecules can twist around in space. Why is this
important?
Let’s stay with the people analogy. Think about how many common positions
you assume every day. You can sit, you can stand, you can lean against something,
you can lie down, you can even stand on your head, and so on. Some of these positions
are comfortable (such as lying down), while other positions are very uncomfortable
(such as standing on your head). There are some activities, like drinking a
glass of water, which can be done only in certain positions. You cannot drink a glass
of water while lying down or standing on your head.
Molecules are very similar. They have many positions into which they can
twist and bend. There are some comfortable positions (low in energy), while other
positions are uncomfortable (high in energy). The various positions available to a
molecule are called conformations. It is important to be able to predict the conformations
available to molecules, because there are certain activities that can be performed
only in specific conformations. Just as a person standing on her head cannot
drink a glass of water, so, too, molecules cannot undergo some reactions from certain
conformations. Just as you can run only when you are in a standing position,
molecules can often undergo certain reactions from only one specific conformation.
If the molecule cannot twist into the conformation necessary for a reaction to take
place, then the reaction will not happen. So you can understand why you will need
to be able to predict what conformations are available to molecules—so that you can
predict when reactions can and cannot happen.
There are two very important drawing styles that show conformations and give
us the power to predict what conformations are available to different types of molecules:
Newman projections and chair conformations:
Newman projection Chair
We begin this chapter with Newman projections.
104
CHAPTER6
CONFORMATIONS
6.1 HOW TO DRAW A
NEWMAN PROJECTION
Before we can talk about drawing Newman projections, we need to first review one
aspect of drawing bond-line structures that we did not cover in Chapter 1. To show
how groups are positioned in 3D space, we often use wedges and dashes:
In the bond-line drawing above, the fluorine atom is on a wedge and the chlorine
atom is on a dash. The wedge means that the fluorine is coming out toward us in 3D
space, and the dash means that the chlorine is going away from us in 3D space.
Imagine that all four carbon atoms in the molecule above are positioned in the plane
of the page. If you look at this page from the left side (so the page looks twodimensional),
you would see the fluorine sticking out of the page to your right and
the chlorine sticking out of the page to the left.
Do not be confused by whether the dash is drawn on the right or left:
In both drawings above, the chlorine is on a dash and the fluorine is on a
wedge, so these drawings are the same. In reality, both the chlorine and the fluorine
should be drawn straight up—the chlorine goes straight up and behind the page,
while the fluorine goes straight up and in front of the page. If we drew it like that,
we would not be able to see the chlorine because the fluorine would be blocking it
(the way the moon blocks the sun in a solar eclipse). To clearly see both groups, we
move one of the groups slightly to the left and the other slightly to the right. It does
not matter which is on the right and which is on the left. All that matters is which
one is on the wedge and which one is on the dash.
Now that we understand what the dash and wedge mean, let’s consider what
the molecule would look like from a slightly different angle:
Imagine looking at the molecule from the angle shown by the arrow above. If you
are not sure what angle we are talking about, try doing the following: Turn your book
so that it is facing your stomach instead of your head. Now turn the page so you are
looking at it from the side, like we did before. You should be looking down the

path of this arrow at the molecule. In this view, you are looking directly down a
carbon–carbon bond, where one carbon is in front and one is in back:
In this view, you will see three groups connected to the front carbon atom. You
should expect to see a fluorine atom sticking out of the page to the right and a chlorine
atom sticking out of the page to the left. You would also see a methyl group
pointing straight down. This is what it would look like from that view:
You would see the three groups like this, and you would not see the back carbon
atom, because the carbon atom in front would be covering it up (again, like the moon
covers the sun during a solar eclipse). Let’s try to draw that back carbon that we cannot
see, and by convention, we will draw it as a big circle:
Now we place the three groups that are on the back carbon atom into our drawing.
There is one methyl group and two hydrogen atoms. If we put them into our drawing,
then we get our Newman projection. It looks like this:
It is important that you can see what this drawing represents, because we cannot
move forward until you see it very clearly. We are essentially looking at a carbon–
carbon bond, focusing on the three groups attached to each carbon atom. The central
point in our Newman projection (where the lines to the Cl, F, and Me meet each
other) is the first carbon. The big circle in the back is our back carbon. All at once

you can see all six groups (the three connected to the front carbon atom and the three
connected to the back carbon atom). So a Newman projection is another way of
drawing the compound we showed earlier:
Let’s use one more analogy to help us understand this. Imagine that you are
looking at a fan that has three blades. Behind this fan, there is another fan that also
has three blades. So you see a total of six blades. If both fans were spinning, and you
started taking photographs, you might find some photos where you can clearly see
all six blades, and other photos where the three blades in the front are blocking our
view of the three blades in the back. In this last case, the three blades in front would
be eclipsing the three blades in back.
This is where the analogy helps us understand why Newman projections are
useful. The bond connecting the two carbon atoms is a single bond that can freely
rotate. Sometimes, you can see all six groups because they are staggered. But other
times, you can’t see the groups in the back because they are being eclipsed by the
three groups in the front:
Think of the front carbon atom and its three groups as one fan, and the back
carbon atom and its three groups as a different fan. These two fans can spin independently
of each other, which gives rise to many different possible conformations.
This is why Newman projections are so incredibly powerful at showing conformations.
They are drawn in a way that is perfect for showing the various conformations
that arise as an individual single bond rotates.
It gets a little more complicated when we realize that every single bond in
every molecule can freely rotate, giving rise to a very large number of conformations
for molecules. We can avoid that kind of complexity by focusing just on one particular
bond, and the various conformations that arise from free rotation of just that
bond. If we can learn how to do that, then we can do that for the part of the molecule
that is undergoing a reaction and we do not need to concern ourselves with the
rest of the molecule.

EXERCISE 6.1 Draw a Newman projection of the following compound looking
from the perspective of the arrow:
Answer The first thing to realize is that there are groups on dashes and wedges
that have not been shown. They are the hydrogen atoms. We did not focus on drawing
the dashes and wedges in Chapter 1, but the hydrogen atoms are, in fact, on
dashes and wedges. We learned in the chapter on geometry that these carbon atoms
would be classified as sp3 hybridized, and, therefore, their geometry is tetrahedral.
That means the hydrogen atoms are coming in and out of the page:
Now we draw the front carbon atom with its three groups. Looking along the direction
of the arrow, we see a hydrogen atom that is up and to the left, another hydrogen
atom that is up and to the right, and a methyl group pointing straight down. So
we draw it like this:
Next we draw the back carbon atom as a large circle and we look at all three groups
attached to it. There is a methyl group pointing straight up and then two hydrogen
atoms pointing left and right. So the answer is

6.2 RANKING THE STABILITY
OF NEWMAN PROJECTIONS
We have seen that Newman projections are a powerful way to show the different
conformations of a molecule. We mentioned earlier that there are staggered conformations
and eclipsed conformations. In fact, there are three staggered and three
eclipsed conformations. Let’s draw all three staggered conformations of butane. The
best way to do this is to keep the back carbon atom motionless (so the fan in the back
is not spinning), and let’s slowly turn the groups in the front (only the front fan is
spinning):

Answer Answer
Look at the first drawing above and notice the placement of the methyl group at the
bottom. If we rotate the front carbon atom clockwise with all three of its groups, this
methyl ends up in the top left (as seen in the second drawing). Then we rotate one
more time to get the third drawing. Rotating one more time regenerates the first
drawing. In the first drawing, the methyl groups are as far away from each other as
possible, which is the most stable conformation, called the anti conformation. The
other two drawings both have the methyl groups near each other in space. They feel
each other and they are a bit crowded. This interaction is called a gauche interaction,
which makes these conformations a little bit less stable than the anti conformation.
If we were to go back to our comparison between molecules and people, we
would say that the anti conformation would be like lying down in a bed, and the
gauche conformations are both like sitting in a chair. All of these are comfortable
positions, but lying down is the most comfortable. The anti conformation is the
most stable.
Now let’s look at the three eclipsed conformations of butane. Again, let’s keep
the back where it is, and let’s just rotate the front carbon atom with its three groups:
These conformations are all high in energy relative to the staggered conformations.
All of the groups are eclipsing each other, so they are very crowded. All
three of these would be like standing on your head, which is extremely uncomfortable.
But the middle one is the most unstable, because the two methyl groups (the
two largest groups) are eclipsing each other. This would be like standing on your
head without using your hands for help—now that really hurts. So, all of these are
high in energy, but the middle one is the most unstable.
To summarize, the most stable conformation will be the staggered conformation
where the large groups are as far apart as possible (anti), and the least stable
conformation will be the eclipsed conformation where the large groups are eclipsing
each other.
EXERCISE 6.8 Draw the most stable and the least stable conformations of the
following compound, using Newman projections looking down the following bond:

and two hydrogen atoms connected to the front carbon atom, and there will be an
ethyl group and two hydrogen atoms connected to the back carbon atom, in the following
way:
Now we decide how to rotate the front carbon atom so as to provide the most stable
conformation. The most stable conformation will be a staggered conformation with
the two largest groups anti to each other, so in this case, we do not need to rotate at
all. The drawing that we just drew is already the most stable conformation, because
the methyl and ethyl groups are anti to each other:
To find the least stable conformation, we need to rotate the front carbon atom and
consider all three eclipsed conformations. The least stable conformation will be the
one with the two largest groups eclipsing each other:

6.3 DRAWING CHAIR CONFORMATIONS 113
6.3 DRAWING CHAIR CONFORMATIONS
An interesting case of conformational analysis comes to play when we consider a
six-membered ring (cyclohexane). There are many conformations that this compound
can adopt. You will see them all in your textbook: the chair, the boat, the
twist-boat. The most stable conformation of cyclohexane is the chair. We call it a
chair, because when you draw it, it looks like a chair:
You can almost imagine someone sitting on this structure, as if it were a beach chair.
Most students have a difficult time drawing the chair and its substituents correctly.
In this section, we will focus on learning how to draw the chair correctly. It is very
important, because we cannot move on to see more about chairs until you know how
to draw them.
You will need to practice this, step by step. Begin by drawing a very wide V:
Next, draw a line from the top right of the V, going down at a 60-degree angle, and
stop a little bit to the right of an imaginary line coming straight down from the center
of the V:
Next, draw a line parallel to the left side of the V and stop a little bit to the right of
an imaginary line coming straight down from the top left of the V:
Then, start at the top left of the V and draw a line parallel to the line all the way on
the right side, going down exactly as low as that line goes:
114 CHAPTER 6 CONFORMATIONS
Finally, connect the last two lines:
Please don’t ever draw a chair like this:
When you draw the chair sloppily (as so many students do), it makes it impossible
to place the substituents correctly on the ring. And that’s when you start losing silly
points on your exam. So, take the time to practice and learn how to draw it properly.
Practice in the space below:
Now we can start drawing in the substituents. Start with the top right corner and
draw a line going straight up:
Then go around the ring and draw a straight line at each carbon atom, alternating between
up and down:
These six substituents are called axial substituents. They go straight up and down, in
the order shown above.
Next we need to learn how to draw the equatorial substituents. These are the
substituents pointing out toward the sides. There are also six of them. Each one is
drawn so that it is parallel to the two bonds from which it is once removed:
We go all the way around the ring like this, until we have drawn all of the equatorial groups:
Now we know how to draw all twelve substituents, but remember that if we
draw a line and don’t put anything at the end of that line, then this implies a methyl
group. So, unless we are referring to dodecamethylcyclohexane (that’s 12 methyl
groups), we should really draw hydrogen atoms at the end of these lines:

6.3 DRAWING CHAIR CONFORMATIONS 115
116 CHAPTER 6 CONFORMATIONS
Generally, we do not have to draw all 12 lines and place hydrogen atoms there. Remember
how bond-line drawings work: if we don’t draw any groups at all, it is assumed
that there are hydrogen atoms. We are going through this exercise because it is
important to know how to draw all 12 substituents. We will see in the next section that
in most problems you will need to draw only a few of them. Which ones you draw will
depend on the problem. So the only way to be sure that you can draw whatever the
problem throws at you is to master drawing all of them. Never draw groups like this:
Very bad
Drawings like this will cause you to lose serious points on exams (not to mention the
fact that a drawing like this defeats the whole purpose of a chair drawing—the exact
positioning of the substituents is very important).
Use the space below to practice drawing a chair with all twelve substituents.
When you are finished, label every substituent as axial or equatorial. Do not move
on to the next section until you can do this.
6.4 PLACING GROUPS ON THE CHAIR
Now we need to see how to draw a chair with proper placement of the groups when
we are given a regular hexagon-style drawing:
Before we can get started, we need to remember what the dashes and wedges
mean in the hexagon-style drawing. Remember that wedges are coming out toward
Br
Cl
is the same as
Br
Cl
you, and dashes are going back away from you. So, at each of the six carbon atoms
of the ring, there are two groups—one coming out at you and one going away from
you. If the groups are not drawn, then it means that there are two hydrogen atoms,
one coming out and one going away.
Now let’s introduce some new terminology. This is not scientific terminology,
and you likely won’t find it in your textbook, but it will help you master the task at
hand. Anything coming off of the ring that is on a wedge, we will call up, because
the group is coming up above the ring. Any group on a dash, we will call down, because
the group is going down below the ring. So in the example above, Br is up and
Cl is down.
Now let’s apply the same terminology to the groups on a chair. Each carbon atom
has two groups, one pointing above the ring (up) and one pointing below the ring (down):
You can do this for every carbon (and you should try on the drawing above), and you
will see that each carbon has two groups (up and down). It is important to realize that
there is no correlation between up/down and axial/equatorial. Look at the drawing
above. For one of the carbon atoms, the up position is axial. For the other carbon
atom showing its groups, the up position is equatorial. Take a close look at the two
equatorial positions shown above. One of them is up and the other is down.
Now we are ready to draw a chair when we are given a hexagon. Let’s work
through the example that we started with:
We begin by placing numbers. These are not the same as the numbers that we used
in naming compounds. These are just numbers that help us draw the chair with the
groups in the right place. It does not matter where we start or which direction we go
in, so let’s just say that we will always start at the top and go clockwise:
Now, we draw a chair and we put numbers on the chair also. We can start our
numbers anywhere on the chair, but we must go in the same direction that we did in

the hexagon. If we went clockwise there, then we must go clockwise here. To avoid
a mistake, let’s just say that we will always go clockwise from now on and we will
always start at the top right corner:
Now we know where to put in the groups. Br is on the carbon numbered 1, and
Cl is on the carbon numbered 3. This brings us to the up/down system. Draw the
chair, showing both positions (up and down) at each of the carbon atoms where we
need to place a group:
Look at the hexagon drawing again and ask whether each group is up or down.
Br is on a wedge, so it is up. Cl is on a dash, so it is down. Now we are ready to put
the groups into our chair drawing:
That’s all there is to it. To review, we need to draw the chair, number the chair and
hexagon (both clockwise), determine where the groups go, determine whether they
are up or down, and then draw them in. Let’s get some practice now.

6.4 PLACING GROUPS ON THE CHAIR 119
Answer Begin by numbering the hexagon at the first group and then going clockwise.
This puts the OH at the position numbered 1 and the Me at the position
numbered 2:
Next draw the chair, number it going clockwise, and then put in the up and down
positions at the carbon atoms numbered 1 and 2:
Finally, place the groups where they belong. The OH should be at the number 1
position in the down direction (because it was on a dash in the hexagon drawing),
and the Me should be at the number 2 position in the up direction (because it was
on a wedge):
The example above illustrates an important point. Take a close look at the Me
and the OH in the hexagon drawing. One is on a wedge and one is on a dash. We call
this relationship trans (when you have two groups that are on opposite sides of the
ring). If the two groups had been on the same side (either both on wedges, or both
on dashes), then we would have called them cis. So in the example above, the groups
are trans to each other. Now take a close look at the chair drawing we just drew
above. The OH and Me don’t look trans in this drawing. In fact, they look like they
are cis, but they are trans. The OH is in the down position and the Me is in the up
position.
It will become very clear that these groups are trans to each other when we
learn how to draw the chair after it has “flipped” to give us a new chair drawing. We
will see this in the next section. For now, let’s get some practice drawing the first
chair correctly.

6.5 RING FLIPPING
Ring flipping is one of the most important aspects of understanding chair conformations,
yet students commonly misunderstand this. Let’s try to avoid the mistake
by starting off with what ring flipping is not. It is not simply turning the ring over:
It makes sense why students think that this would be a flip—after all, this is the common
meaning of the word “flipping.” But we are talking about something very different
when we say that rings can flip. Here is what we really mean:
Notice that in the drawing on the left, the left side of the chair is pointing down. In
the drawing on the right, the left side of the chair is pointing up. This is a different
chair. Also notice that the chlorine went from being in an equatorial position to being
in an axial position. This is a critical feature of ring flips. When performing a ring
flip, all axial positions become equatorial, and all equatorial positions become axial.
Let’s consider an analogy to help us get through this. Imagine that you are
walking down a long hallway. Your hands are swaying back and forth as you walk,
as most people do with their hands when they walk. One second, your left hand is in
front of you and your right hand is behind you; the next second, it switches. Your
hands switch back and forth with every step you take. The cyclohexane ring is doing
something similar. It is moving around all of the time, flipping back and forth between
two different chair conformations. So all of the substituents are constantly
flipping back and forth between being axial and being equatorial.
There is one more important feature to recognize. Let’s go back to the example
above with the chlorine. We said that the chair flip moves the chlorine from an
equatorial position into an axial position. But what about the up/down terminology?
Let’s see:
Cl
H
down
Cl
H

Cl

a ring flip
6.5 RING FLIPPING 121
Notice that the chlorine is down all of the time. In other words, up/down is not something
that changes during a ring flip, but axial/equatorial does change during a ring
flip. This illustrates that there is no relationship between up/down and axial/equatorial.
If a substituent is up, then it will stay up all of the time, throughout the ring flipping
process.
So now we can understand that a common hexagon-style drawing represents a
molecule that is flipping back and forth between two chair conformations. The hexagon
drawing shows us which substituents are up and which are down. That never
changes. But whether those groups are axial or equatorial will depend on which
chair you are drawing. So far, we have learned how to draw only one of these chairs.
Now we will learn how to draw the other.
The process for drawing the skeleton of the chair is very similar to how we did
it before. The only difference is that we draw our lines in the other direction. When
we drew our first chair, we followed these steps:
Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5
Now, to draw the other chair, we follow these steps:
Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5
Compare the method for drawing the second chair to the method for drawing the
first. The key is in step 2. If you compare step 2 for the first and second chair, everything
else should flow from there. Use the following space to practice drawing the
second chair:
Now, let’s make sure you know how to draw the substituents. The rules are the same
as before. All axial positions are drawn straight up and down, alternating:
122 CHAPTER 6 CONFORMATIONS
and all equatorial positions are drawn parallel to the two bonds that are once
removed:
PROBLEM
6.22 In the space below, practice drawing the second chair, showing all 12
substituents.
Let’s now go back and review, because it is important that you understand the
following points. When we are given a hexagon-style drawing, the drawing shows
us which positions are up and which positions are down. No matter which chair we
draw, up will always be up, and down will always be down. There are two chair conformations
for this compound, and the molecule is flipping back and forth between
these two conformations. With each flip, axial positions become equatorial positions
and vice versa. Let’s see an example.
Consider the following compound:
Notice that there are two groups on this ring. Cl is down (because it is on a dash),
and Br is up (because it is on a wedge). There are two chair conformations that we
can draw for this compound:
Cl

Br
H

Parallel to these bonds which are once removed

6.5 RING FLIPPING 123
In both chair conformations, Cl is down and Br is up. The difference between these
drawings is the axial/equatorial positions. In the conformation on the left, both
groups are equatorial. In the conformation on the right, both groups are axial.
So any hexagon-style drawing will have two chair conformations. Now let’s
focus on making sure you can draw both conformations for any compound. We already
saw in the last section how to draw the first one. We used a numbering system to determine
where to put the groups, and we used the up/down terminology to figure exactly
how to draw them (whether to draw them as equatorial or axial). To draw the
second chair, we simply follow the same procedure. We begin by drawing the skeleton
for the second chair (this is where you begin to see the difference between the chairs):
Once we have drawn the skeleton, we number the carbon atoms going clockwise.
Then we place the groups in the correct positions, making sure to draw them in the
correct direction (up or down). So we can really use this method to draw both chairs
at the same time. Let’s do an example.
EXERCISE 6.23 Draw both chair conformations for the following compound:
Answer Begin by numbering the hexagon clockwise. This puts the OH at the
position numbered 1 and the Me at the position numbered 2.
Next draw both chair skeletons and number them clockwise. Then put in the up and
down positions at the carbon atoms numbered 1 and 2:

Finally, place the groups where they belong in both chairs. The OH should be at the
number 1 position in the down direction (because it was on a dash in the hexagon
drawing), and the Me should be at the number 2 position in the up direction (because
it was on a wedge):
When we redraw these compounds without showing any numbers or hydrogen
atoms, it is clear to see that we need to go through these steps methodically because
the relationship between these two conformations is not so obvious:

cyclohexane. Draw the other chair (i.e., do a ring flip):

Once you have drawn both chair conformations for a substituted cyclohexane, you
should be able to predict which conformation is more stable. This is where it gets
important for reactivity. Imagine that you are learning about a reaction that can proceed
only if a certain group is in an axial position (you will learn about a reaction
like this very soon—it is called E2). You already know that the groups are flipping
back and forth between axial and equatorial positions (as it goes back and forth from
one chair to the other). But what if one of the chairs is so unstable that the ring is
spending 99% of its time in the other chair conformation? Then the question becomes,
where is the important group in the stable chair conformation? Is it axial or
6.6 COMPARING THE STABILITY OF CHAIRS 127
equatorial? If it is equatorial, then the reaction can’t happen. It could happen only
during the 1% of the time that the group is in the axial position, so the reaction would
be very slow. However, if the group is in an axial position 99% of the time, then the
reaction will happen very quickly.
So you can see that it is important to understand what makes chair conformations
unstable. There is really only one rule you need to worry about: a chair will be
more stable with a group in an equatorial position, because it is not bumping into
anything (this bumping is called steric hindrance). Axial positions are bumping into
other axial positions, but equatorial positions are not:
The larger the group, the more it will prefer to be equatorial. So, a tert-butyl group
will spend almost all of its time in an equatorial position. This essentially “locks” the
ring in one conformation and prevents the ring from flipping (the truth is that the ring
is still flipping, but the ring is spending more than 99% of its time in the more stable
chair conformation):
So what happens if you also have a chlorine atom on the ring that is axial while the
tert-butyl group is equatorial?
This will essentially lock the ring in the chair conformation that puts the chlorine in
an axial position. If we are trying to run a reaction where the Cl needs to be axial,
then this effect will speed up the reaction. However, if the Cl is locked in an equatorial
position, then the reaction will be too slow:

128 CHAPTER 6 CONFORMATIONS
Now we understand why this can be important. So let’s go step by step in determining
which of two chair conformations is more stable.
If you have only one group on the ring, then the more stable chair will be the
one with the group in an equatorial position:
If you have two groups, then it is best if both can occupy equatorial positions:
If only one can be equatorial in either chair, then the more stable chair will be the
one with the larger group in the equatorial position:
In the example above, we have a choice to put the tert-butyl group in an equatorial
position or the methyl group in an equatorial position. We can’t have both. So we put
the tert-butyl in an equatorial position.
If the ring has more than two groups, you just use the same logic that we used
above to choose the more stable chair. Just try to put the largest groups in equatorial
positions.
EXERCISE 6.37 For the following compound, draw the most stable chair
conformation:

this, review the two previous sections in this chapter):

6.7 DON’T BE CONFUSED BY
THE NOMENCLATURE
Some nomenclature is always confusing to students, so it is worth a couple of paragraphs
to clear things up. When two groups are both up or both down, we call them
cis to each other; when one group is up and one group is down, we call them trans
to each other:
Do not confuse this with cis and trans double bonds. There are no double bonds
here. Don’t draw any double bonds. It is amazing how many students will draw a
double bond when you ask them to draw cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. Remember
that the ending –ane- means that there are no double bonds anywhere in the molecule.
The only comparison between double bonds and disubstituted cylohexanes is
that, in both cases, cis means “on the same side” and trans means “on opposite
sides.”
cis trans
6.7 DON’T BE CONFUSED BY THE NOMENCLATURE 131
In the previous chapter, we saw that molecules can assume many different conformations,
much like a person. You can move your hands all around: hold them
straight up in the air, out to the sides, straight down, and so on. In all of these positions,
your right hand is still your right hand, regardless of how you move it around.
There is no way to twist your right hand to turn it into a left hand. The reason it is
always a right hand has nothing to do with the fact that it is connected to your right
shoulder. If you were to chop off your arms and sew them on backward (don’t try
this at home!), you would not look normal. You would look like someone with his
right hand attached to his left shoulder and vice versa. You would look very strange,
to say the least.
Your right hand is a right hand because it fits into a right-handed glove, and it
does not fit into a left-handed glove. This will always be true no matter how you
move your hand. Molecules can have this property also.
It is possible for a molecule to have a region where there are two possibilities
for how the atoms can be connected in 3D space, much like the difference between
a right hand and a left hand. Instead of “right hand” and “left hand,” we call the two
possibilities R and S. When we talk about the configuration of a compound, we are
talking about whether it is R or S. If the arrangement is S, then it will always be S no
matter how the arms of the molecule twist about as the molecule moves. In other
words, the molecule can move into any conformation it wants, but the configuration
will never change. The only way for a configuration to change would be to undergo
a chemical reaction.
This explains something we saw in the previous chapter: when drawing chair
conformations, we saw that up is always up regardless of which chair you draw. That
is because up and down are issues of configuration, which does not change when the
molecule twists into another conformation.
Don’t confuse conformation with configuration. Students confuse these terms
all of the time. Conformations are the different positions that a molecule can twist
into, but configuration is a matter of right-handedness or left-handedness (R or S).
In molecules, the regions that can be R or S are called stereocenters (or chiral
centers—chiral is Greek for “hand,” and we can understand the symbolism there). In
this chapter, we will learn how to locate stereocenters, how to draw them properly,
how to label them as R or S, and what happens when you have more than one stereocenter
in a compound.
This is all extremely important stuff. You will understand this as soon as you
begin learning reactions. You will see that some reactions convert a stereocenter
132
CHAPTER7
CONFIGURATIONS
from R into S (and vice versa), while other reactions will not. To predict the products
of a reaction, you absolutely must know how to show these stereocenters, and you
must understand what is happening to them in a reaction.
7.1 LOCATING STEREOCENTERS
For purposes of this course, we will define a stereocenter as a carbon atom with four
different groups on it. For example,
This drawing has a carbon in the center with four different groups: ethyl, methyl,
bromine, and chlorine. Therefore, we have a stereocenter. Anytime you have four
different groups connected to a carbon atom, there will be two ways to arrange the
groups in space (always two; never more and never less). These two arrangements
are different configurations:
These two compounds are different from each other even though the atoms
are connected in the same way. The difference between them comes from their
positions in 3D space. Therefore, they are called stereoisomers (“stereo” for space).
More specifically, they are called enantiomers, because the two compounds are
mirror images of each other and they are not superimposable. If we construct models
of these two compounds, we see that they are not the same—i.e., they cannot be
superimposed.
Notice that we are not looking at just the four atoms that are connected to the
carbon atom in the middle (which would be Br, Cl, C, and C—and we might think
that two of these are the same), but we are looking at the entire groups. In other words,
whenever we look at the four groups connected to an atom, we are looking at the entire
molecule, no matter how big those groups are. Consider the following example:
All four of these groups are different.
Et Me
Br Cl
Et Me
Cl Br
and
Et Me
Br Cl
7.1 LOCATING STEREOCENTERS 133
You must learn how to recognize when an atom has four different groups attached
to it. To help you with this, let’s begin with examples that are not stereocenters:
The carbon atom indicated above is not a stereocenter because there are two groups
that are the same (there are two ethyl groups). The same is true in the following case:
Whether you go around the ring clockwise or counterclockwise, you see the same
thing, so this is not a stereocenter. If we wanted to make it a stereocenter, we could
do so by putting a group on the ring:
Usually, stereocenters are drawn with dashes and wedges to show the configuration.
If the dashes and wedges are not drawn, then we assume that there is a mixture
of equal amounts of both configurations (which we call a racemic mixture). In
fact, in the compound above, there is a second stereocenter. Can you find it? Each of
the two stereocenters in the compound above can be either R or S. Since there are
two stereocenters, there will be four possibilities: R,R and R,S and S,R and S,S. Since
neither stereocenter has been drawn with dashes and wedges, we must assume that
we have all four possible stereoisomers.
EXERCISE 7.1 In the compound below, there is one stereocenter. Find it.
Answer Let’s start on the left side and work our way across the compound. The
methyl group has three hydrogen atoms, so that can’t be it. Then there is a CH2
group, which also cannot be it, because two groups are the same (two H’s). Then you
have a carbon atom with four different groups: ethyl (on the left), methyl (on the

right), OH sticking up, and H (don’t forget about the H’s that are not shown). This
is our stereocenter.
PROBLEMS In each of the compounds below, there is one stereocenter. Find it.
7.1 LOCATING STEREOCENTERS 135
In the previous problems, you knew that you were looking for just one stereocenter.
Hopefully, you started to realize some tricks that make it faster to find the
stereocenter (for example, ignore CH2 groups). So, now, we will move on to examples
where you don’t know how many stereocenters there are. There could be five
stereocenters or there could be none.
EXERCISE 7.8 In the following compound, find all of the stereocenters, if any:
Answer If we go around the ring, we find that there are only six carbon atoms in
this compound. Four of them are CH2 groups, so we know that they are not stereocenters.
If we look at the remaining two carbon atoms, we see that each of them is
connected to four different groups. They are both stereocenters.

7.2 DETERMINING THE CONFIGURATION
OF A STEREOCENTER
Now that we can find stereocenters, we must now learn how to determine whether a
stereocenter is R or S. There are two steps involved in making the determination.
First, we give each of the four groups a number (from 1 to 4). Then we use the orientation
of these numbers to determine the configuration. So, how do we assign
numbers to each of the groups?
We start by making a list of the four atoms attached to the stereocenter. Let’s
look at the following example:
The four atoms attached to the stereocenter are C, C, O, and H. We rank them from
1 to 4 based on atomic number. To do this, we must either consult a periodic table
every time or commit to memory a small part of the periodic table—just those atoms
that are most commonly used in organic chemistry:
When comparing the four atoms in the example above, we see that oxygen has the
highest atomic number, so we give it the first priority—we give it the number 1. Hydrogen
is the smallest atom, so it will always get the number 4 (lowest priority) when
a stereocenter has a hydrogen atom. We don’t have to worry about what to do if there
are two hydrogen atoms, because if there were, it would not be a stereocenter. But it
is possible to have two carbon atoms, as in the example above. So how do we figure
out which carbon gets the number 2 priority and which gets the number 3 priority?

7.13 7.14
This is how we rank the two carbon atoms: for each carbon atom, we write a
list of three atoms it is connected to (other than the stereocenter). Let’s do the example
above to see how this works. The carbon atom on the left side of the stereocenter
has four bonds: one to the stereocenter, one to another carbon atom, and then
two hydrogen atoms. So, other than the stereocenter, it has three bonds (C, H, and
H). Now let’s look at the carbon atom on the right side of the stereocenter. It has four
bonds: one to the stereocenter and then three hydrogen atoms. So, other than the
stereocenter, it has three bonds (H, H, and H). We compare the two lists and look for
the first point of difference:
C H
H H
H H
We see the first point of difference immediately: carbon beats hydrogen. So the left
side of the stereocenter gets priority over the right side, and the numbering turns out
like this:
EXERCISE 7.16 In the compound below, find the stereocenter, and label the four
groups from 1 to 4 using the system of priorities based on atomic number.
Answer The four atoms attached to the stereocenter are C, C, Cl, and F. Of these,
Cl has the highest atomic number, so it gets the first priority. Then comes F as number
2. We need to decide which carbon atom gets the number 2 and which carbon atom
gets the number 3. We do this by listing the three atoms attached to each of them:
Left Side Right Side
C C
H C
H H
So the right side wins. Therefore, the numbering goes like this:
Cl F
1 2
4 3
Cl F
H OH
2

7.2 DETERMINING THE CONFIGURATION OF A STEREOCENTER 137
PROBLEMS In each of the compounds below, find the stereocenter, and label the
four groups from 1 to 4 using the system of priorities based on atomic number.
138 CHAPTER 7 CONFIGURATIONS
There are a few more situations you should know how to deal with when numbering
the four groups. If you are comparing two carbon atoms and you find that the three
atoms on one side are the same as the three atoms on the other, then keep going farther
out until you find the first difference:
Also, you should know that we are looking for the first point of difference as
we travel out, and we don’t add the atomic numbers. This is best explained with an
example:
In this example, we know that the Br gets the first priority, and the H gets the number
4. When comparing the two carbon atoms, we find the following situation:
Left Side Right Side
C O
C H
C H
In this case, we do not add the atomic numbers and say that the left side wins.
Rather we go down the list and compare each row. In the first row above, we have
C versus O. That’s it, end of story—the O wins. It doesn’t matter what comes in
the next two rows. Always look for the first point of difference. So the priorities
go like this:
2
1
3
4
H Br
OH

2

H SH
7.17 7.18 7.19
Finally, you should count a double bond as if the atom were connected to two
carbon atoms. For example,
The group on the left gets the number 2, because we counted the following way:
Left Side Right Side
C C
C H
H H
EXERCISE 7.20 In the compound below, find the stereocenter, and label the four
groups from 1 to 4 using the system of priorities based on atomic number.
Answer All four atoms connected to the stereocenter are carbon atoms, so we
need to compare the three atoms connected in all four cases:
The oxygen atom wins. Next comes the one with three carbon atoms. The remaining
two are the same, so we need to move out one farther on the chain and compare
again. Remember to count the double bond like two carbon atoms:

Now we need to learn how to use this numbering system to determine the configuration
of a stereocenter. The idea is simple, but it is difficult to do if you have a
hard time closing your eyes and rotating 3D objects in your mind. For those who cannot
do this, don’t worry. There is a trick. Let’s first see how to do it without the trick.
If the number 4 group is pointing away from us (on the dash), then we ask
whether 1, 2, and 3 are going clockwise or counterclockwise:
In the example on the left, we see that 1, 2, 3 go clockwise, which is called R. In the
example on the right, we see that 1, 2, 3 go counterclockwise, which is called S. If
the molecule is already drawn with the number 4 priority on the dash, then your life
is very simple:
H OH

3
4
1
2
4
3
1
2
4
3
Clockwise Counterclockwise
R S
The 4 is already on the dash, so you just look at 1, 2, and 3. In this case, they go
counterclockwise, so it is S.
It gets a little more difficult when the number 4 is not on a dash, because then
you must rotate the molecule in your mind. For example,
Let’s redraw just the stereocenter showing the location of the four priorities:
Now we need to rotate the molecule so that the fourth priority is on a dash. To do
this, imagine spearing the molecule with a pencil and then rotating the pencil 90°:
Now the 4 is on a dash, so we can look at 1, 2, and 3, and we see that they go counterclockwise.
Therefore, the configuration is S.
Let’s see one more example:
We redraw just the stereocenter showing the location of the four priorities, and then
we spear the molecule with a pencil and rotate 180° to put the 4 on a dash:
1
2

7.2 DETERMINING THE CONFIGURATION OF A STEREOCENTER 141
Now, the 4 is on a dash, so we can look at 1, 2, and 3, and we see that they go clockwise.
Therefore, the configuration is R.
And now, for the trick. If you were able to see all of that, great! But if you had
trouble seeing the molecules in 3D, there is a simple trick that will help you get the
answer every time. To understand how the trick works, you need to realize that if you
redraw the molecule so that any two of the four groups are switched, then you have
switched the configuration (R turns into S, and S turns into R):
You can use this idea to your advantage. Here is the trick: Switch the number 4 with
whatever group is on the dash—then your answer is the opposite of what you see.
Let’s do an example:
This looks tough because the 4 is on a wedge. But let’s do the trick: switch the 4 with
whichever group is on the dash; in this case, we switch the 4 with the 1:
After doing the switch, the 4 is on a dash, and it becomes easy to figure out. It is
counterclockwise, which means S. We had to do one switch to make it easy to figure
out, which means that we changed the configuration. So if it became S after the
switch, then it must have been R before the switch. That’s the trick. But be careful.
This trick will work every time, but you must not forget that the answer you immediately
get is the opposite of the real answer, because you did one switch.
Now, let’s practice determining R or S when you are given the numbers, so that
we can make sure you know how to do this step. You can either visualize the molecule
in 3D, or you can use the trick—whatever works best for you.

EXERCISE 7.36 The compound below has one stereocenter. Find it, and determine
whether it is R or S:
Answer The carbon atom bearing the two chlorine atoms cannot be the stereocenter
because there are two Cl atoms (two of the same group). The stereocenter is
the carbon atom with the OH group attached. It has four different groups attached to
it. Now that we found it, we need to assign priorities.

The O on the dash gets priority number 1, and the hydrogen atom (not shown,
but it is on a wedge) gets number 4. Between the two carbon atoms, the one on the
right is connected to two Cl atoms. This wins. So the numbers go like this:
The 4 is on a wedge, which makes the problem a little bit difficult. So let’s use the
trick. If we switch the 4 and the 1, we get something that is R. So, it must be that it
was S before we switched the groups and our answer is S.

7.3 NOMENCLATURE
When we learned how to name compounds, we said that we would skip over the
naming of stereocenters until we learned how to determine configuration. Now that
we know how to determine whether a stereocenter is R or S, we can now see how
to include this in the name of a compound. It is actually quite simple. If there is
only one stereocenter, then you simply place either (R) or (S) at the beginning of
the name. For example, 2-butanol has one stereocenter, and can either be (R)-2-butanol
or (S)-2-butanol, depending on the configuration of the stereocenter. If more
than one stereocenter is present, then you must also use numbers to identify the location
of each stereocenter. Consider the following example:
Based on everything we learned in the second chapter (nomenclature), we would name
this compound 3,4-dimethylhexan-2-one. Now we must also add the configurations
O
O
Cl
7.37 7.38 7.39
Br
Br
OH
7.40 7.41 7.42 OH
to the name. The stereocenter on the left is R, and the stereocenter on the right is S. We
use the numbering system of the parent chain to determine where the stereocenters are.
Since the parent chain was numbered left to right, we add (3R,4S) to the name in the
section on stereoisomerism:
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
so the name is: (3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexan-2-one. As we saw earlier, we italicize
stereoisomerism when it is part of a name.
Now let’s turn to a different type of stereoisomerism, one that we already discussed
in the chapter on nomenclature. Let’s look at double bonds. Recall we indicate
the presence of a double bond using the term –en-:
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
And we indicated the position of the double bond with the numbering system. But
then we saw that there are often two ways for the atoms of a double bond to connect
to each other in 3D space. We saw a system for distinguishing these possibilities,
using the terms cis and trans:
This was indicated in the first part of the name (stereoisomerism):
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
This system of identifying double-bond stereoisomers is very limited, because you
need two groups that are the same to use the cis/trans system of naming. So what do
you do if you have four different groups on a double bond? There are still two possible
stereoisomers:
but we cannot use the cis/trans system here. So, we have another system that
allows us to differentiate between these two compounds. This other system uses
the same numbering based on priorities that we used for stereocenters (based
on atomic numbers). We look at both sides of the double bond; each side has
two groups:
H3CO
H3C
H
F
Two groups

7.3 NOMENCLATURE 145
We begin with one side (let’s start with the left), and we ask which of the two groups
on the left has priority:
The oxygen atom gets priority over the carbon atom, based on atomic number. When
comparing the two groups on the right side, the fluorine atom gets priority over the
hydrogen atom, again based on atomic numbers. So now we know which group gets
the priority on each side:
In the example above, it was easy to assign priorities, but what about when it
gets a little more complicated:
In this example, we have to compare carbon atoms to each other. The groups are all
different, so we need to find a way to assign priorities. To do so, we follow the same
rules that we did when assigning priorities with R and S:
1. If the atoms are the same on one side, then just move farther out and analyze
again.
2. One oxygen beats three carbon atoms (remember to look for the first point
of difference).
3. A double bond counts as two individual bonds.
Let’s go back to our first example. We look at the priority group on one side
and the priority group on the other side, and we ask: are these groups on the same
side (like cis) or on opposite sides (like trans)?

The same side is called Z (for the German word “zusammen” meaning together), and
opposite sides are called E (for the German word “entgegen” meaning opposite).
This way of naming double bonds is far superior to cis/trans nomenclature because
you can use this E/Z system for any double bond, even if all four groups are
different. Cis/trans nomenclature requires two groups to be the same.
We include this information in the name of a molecule, very much like we did
for R and S configurations. For example, if the double bond is between carbons numbered
5 and 6 on a parent chain, then we would add the term (5E) or (5Z) at the beginning
of the name.
EXERCISE 7.43 Name the following compound, including stereochemistry in the
beginning of the name.
Answer Remember that we go through all five parts of the name, starting at the
end and working our way backwards:
Stereoisomerism Substituents Parent Unsaturation Functional group
We begin with the functional group. There is no functional group (so the suffix is
–e). Moving backward in the name, we look for any unsaturation, and there is one
double bond (so the unsaturation is –en-). Then, we choose the longest parent
that includes the double bond, which is seven carbon atoms long, so the parent is
–hept-. There are three substituents (two methyl groups and a fluorine), so we add
fluoro and dimethyl before the parent. Then we put in the numbers. We give the double
bond the lowest number, so we number from left to right. This gives us
4-fluoro-3,5-dimethylhept-3-ene
If you do not remember how to do that, then you should review Chapter 5 on nomenclature.
Now we are ready to put in the stereochemistry. The double bond is Z:

7.4 DRAWING ENANTIOMERS
We mentioned before that enantiomers are two compounds that are nonsuperimposable
mirror images. Let’s first clear up the term “enantiomers,” since students
will often use this word incorrectly in a sentence. Let’s compare it to people
again. If two boys are born to the same parents, those boys are called brothers.
Each one is the brother of the other. If you had to describe both of them, you say
that they are brothers. Similarly, when you have two compounds that are nonsuperimposable
mirror images, they are called enantiomers. Each one is the enantiomer
of the other. Together, they are a pair of enantiomers. But what do we
mean by “nonsuperimposable mirror images”? Let’s go back to the brother analogy
to explain it.
Imagine that the two brothers are twins. They are identical in every way
except one. One of them has a mole on his right cheek, and the other has a mole
on his left cheek. This allows you to distinguish them from each other. They are
mirror images of each other, but they don’t look exactly the same (one cannot be
superimposed on top of the other). It is very important to be able to see the relationship
between different compounds. It is important to be able to draw enantiomers.
Later in the course, you will see reactions where a stereocenter
is created and both enantiomers are formed. To predict the products, you must
be able to draw both enantiomers. In this section, we will see how to draw
enantiomers.
The first thing you need to realize is that enantiomers always come in pairs.
Remember that they are mirror images of each other. There are only two sides to a
mirror, so there can be only two different compounds that have this relationship
(nonsuperimposable mirror images). This is very much like the twin brothers. Each
brother only has one twin brother, not more.
So we must learn how to draw one enantiomer when we are given the other.
When we see the different ways of doing this, we will begin to recognize when compounds
are enantiomers and when they are not.
The simplest way to draw an enantiomer is to redraw the carbon skeleton, but
invert all stereocenters. In other words, change all dashes into wedges and change all
wedges into dashes. For example,
The compound above has a stereocenter (what is the configuration?). If we wanted
to draw the enantiomer, we would redraw the compound, but we would turn the
wedge into a dash:
OH
OH
7.4 DRAWING ENANTIOMERS 149
This is a pretty simple procedure for drawing enantiomers. It works for compounds
with many stereocenters just as easily. For example,
We simply invert all stereocenters. This is actually what we would see if we placed
a mirror directly behind the first compound and then looked into the mirror. The carbon
skeleton would look the same, but the stereocenters would all be inverted:

There is another way to draw enantiomers. In the previous method, we placed
an imaginary mirror behind the compound, and we looked into that mirror to see the
reflection. In the second method for drawing enantiomers, we place the imaginary
mirror on the side of the compound, and we look into the mirror to see the reflection.
Let’s see an example:
But why do we need a second way of drawing enantiomers? Didn’t the first method
seem good enough? The first method (switching all dashes with wedges) was pretty
simple to do. But there are times when the first method will not work so well. There
are a few examples of cyclic and bicyclic carbon skeletons where the wedges and

dashes are not drawn, because they are implied. We have actually already seen an example
of one of these: the chair conformation of a substituted cyclohexane.
In this drawing, all of the lines are drawn as straight lines (no wedges and dashes)
even though we know that the bonds are not all in the plane of the page. We don’t
need to draw the wedges and dashes because the geometry can be understood from
the drawing. We could try to draw the enantiomer by converting the drawing into
a hexagon-style drawing (with wedges and dashes), then drawing the enantiomer
using the first method (switching all dashes for wedges), and then redrawing the
chair conformation of that enantiomer. But that is a lot of steps to go through when
there is a simpler way to draw the enantiomer—just put the imaginary mirror on
the side (there is no need to actually draw the mirror), and draw the enantiomer
like this:
Whenever we have a structure where the wedges and dashes are implied but
not drawn, it is much easier to use this method. There are other examples of carbon
skeletons that, by convention, do not show the wedges and dashes. Most of these examples
are rigid bicyclic systems. For example,
When dealing with these kinds of compounds, it is much easier to use the second
method to draw enantiomers. Of course, if you like this method, you can always use
this second method for all compounds (even those that show wedges and dashes).
You should get practice placing the mirror on either side (and you should notice
that you get the same result whether you put the mirror on the left side or the
right side).

7.4 DRAWING ENANTIOMERS 153
7.5 DIASTEREOMERS
In all of our examples so far, we have been comparing two compounds that are mirror
images. For them to be mirror images, they need to have different configurations
for every single stereocenter. Remember that our first method for drawing enantiomers
was to switch all wedges with dashes. For the two compounds to be enantiomers,
every stereocenter had to be inverted. But what happens if we have many
stereocenters and we only invert some of them?
Let’s start off with a simple case where we only have two stereocenters. Consider
the two compounds below:
We can clearly see that they are not the same compound. In other words, they are
nonsuperimposable. But, they are not mirror images of each other. The top stereocenter
has the same configuration in both compounds. If they are not mirror images,
then they are not enantiomers. So what is their relationship? They are called diastereomers.
Diastereomers are any compounds that are nonsuperimposable stereoisomers
that are not mirror images of each other.
We use the term “diastereomer” very much like we used the term “enantiomer”
(remember the brother analogy). One compound is called the diastereomer
of the other, and you can have a group of diastereomers. When we were talking about
enantiomers, we saw that they always come in pairs, never more than two. But diastereomers
can form a much larger family. We can have 100 compounds that are all
diastereomers of each other (if there are enough stereocenters to allow for that many
permutations of the stereocenters).
E/Z isomers (or cis/trans isomers) fall under this category. They are called diastereomers,
because they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other:
If you are given two stereoisomers, you should be able to determine whether they are
enantiomers or diastereomers. All you need to look at are the stereocenters. They
must all be of different configuration for the compounds to be enantiomers.
EXERCISE 7.64 Identify whether the two compounds shown below are enantiomers
or diastereomers:
Answer There are two stereocenters in each compound. The configurations are
different for both stereocenters, so these compounds are enantiomers. In fact, if you
154 CHAPTER 7 CONFIGURATIONS
were given the first compound only, you could have drawn the enantiomer by using
the first method—switching all wedges and dashes.

7.6 MESO COMPOUNDS 155
7.6 MESO COMPOUNDS
This is a topic that notoriously confuses students, so let’s start off with an analogy.
Let’s use the analogy of the twin brothers who look identical except for one feature:
one of them has a mole on the left side of his face, and the other has a mole on the
right side of his face. You can tell them apart based on the mole, and the brothers are
mirror images of each other. Imagine that their parents had other sets of twins, lots
of sets of twins. So, all in all, there are a lot of siblings (who are all brothers and
sisters of each other), but they are paired up, 2 in a group. Each child has only one
twin sibling, who is his or her mirror image. Now imagine that the parents, out of
nowhere, have one more child who is born without a twin—just a regular one-baby
birth. When you look at this family, you would see a lot of sets of twins, and then
one child who has no twin (and has two moles—one on each side of his face). You
might ask that child, where is your twin? Where is your mirror image? He would

answer: I don’t have a twin. I am the mirror image of myself. That’s why the family
has an odd number of children, instead of an even number.
The analogy goes like this: when you have a lot of stereocenters in a compound,
there will be many stereoisomers (brothers and sisters). But, they will be
paired up into sets of enantiomers (twins). Any one molecule will have many, many
diastereomers (brothers and sisters), but it will have only one enantiomer (its mirror
image twin). For example, consider the following compound:
This compound has five stereocenters, so it will have many diastereomers (compounds
where only some of the wedges have been inverted). There are many, many
possible compounds that fit that description, so this compound will have many brothers
and sisters. But this compound will only have one twin—only one enantiomer
(there is only one mirror image of the compound above):
It is possible for a compound to be its own mirror image. In such a case, the compound
will not have a twin. It will be all by itself, and the total number of stereoisomers
will be an odd number, rather than an even number. That one lonely compound
is called a meso compound. If you try to draw the enantiomer (using either of the
methods we have seen), you will find that your drawing will be the same compound
as what you started with.
So how do you know if you have a meso compound?
A meso compound has stereocenters, but the compound also has symmetry
that allows it to be the mirror image of itself. Consider cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane
as an example. This molecule has a plane of symmetry cutting the molecule in half.
Everything on the left side of the plane is mirrored by everything on the right side:
If a molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, then it is a meso compound. If you
try to draw the enantiomer (using either one of the two methods we saw), you will
156 CHAPTER 7 CONFIGURATIONS
find that you are drawing the same thing again. This molecule does not have a twin.
It is its own mirror image:
So, to be meso, the compound needs to be the same as its mirror image. We
have seen that this can happen when we have an internal plane of symmetry. It can
also happen when the compound has a center of inversion. For example,
This compound does not possess a plane of symmetry, but it does have a center of
inversion. If we invert everything around the center of the molecule, we regenerate
the same thing. Therefore, this compound will be superimposable on its mirror
image, and the compound is meso. You will rarely see an example like this one, but
it is not correct to say that the plane of symmetry is the only symmetry element that
makes a compound meso. In fact, there is a whole class of symmetry elements (to
which the plane of symmetry and center of inversion belong) called Sn axes, but we
will not get into this, because it is beyond the scope of the course. For our purposes,
it is enough to look for planes of symmetry.
There is one fail-safe way to tell if a compound is a meso compound: simply
draw what you think should be the enantiomer and see if you can rotate the new
drawing in any way to superimpose on the original drawing. If you can, then the
compound will be meso. If not, then your second drawing is the enantiomer of the
original compound.

Answer We need to try to draw the mirror image and see if it is just the same compound
redrawn. If we use the second method for drawing enantiomers (placing the
mirror on the side), then we will be able to see that the compound we would draw is
the same thing:
Therefore, it is a meso compound.
A simpler way to draw the conclusion would be to recognize that the molecule
has an internal plane of symmetry that chops through the center of one of the methyl
groups:

7.7 DRAWING FISCHER PROJECTIONS
There is an entirely different way to draw stereocenters (instead of using regular
bond-line drawings with dashes and wedges). Fischer projections are helpful for
drawing molecules that have many stereocenters, one after another. These drawings
look like this:

158 CHAPTER 7 CONFIGURATIONS
First we need to understand exactly what these drawings mean, and then we will
learn a step-by-step method for drawing them properly.
Using Fischer projections saves time because we don’t have to draw all of the
dashes and wedges for each stereocenter. Instead, we draw only straight lines, with
the idea that all horizontal lines are coming out at us and all vertical lines are going
away from us. Let’s see exactly how this works. Consider the following molecule,
which is drawn in a zigzag format (R1 and R2 represent groups whose identities are
not being defined yet, because it does not matter for now):
Remember that all of the single bonds are all freely rotating, so there are a large
number of conformations that the molecule can assume. When we rotate a single
bond, the dashes and wedges change, but this is not because the configuration has
changed. Remember that configurations do not change when a molecule twists and
bends. Watch what happens when we rotate one of the single bonds:
Notice that R1 is now pointing straight down, and the OH is now on a dash. The configuration
has not changed. If you need to convince yourself of this, determine the
configuration of that stereocenter in each of two drawings. You will see that it has
not changed.
Now let’s draw another of the possible conformations for this molecule. If we
rotate a couple more single bonds until the carbon skeleton is looping around like a
bracelet, we get the following conformation:
The molecule is twisting and bending around all of the time, and the conformation
with the bracelet-shaped skeleton is just one of the possible conformations.
The molecule probably spends very little of its time like this (it is a relatively high
energy conformation), but this is the conformation that we will use to draw our
Fischer projection.
Now imagine piercing a pencil through R1 and R2 (the pencil is represented by
the dotted line below). If you grab the ends of the pencil and rotate, you will find that

R1 and R2 will stay in the page, but the rest of the molecule will pop out in front of
the page:
Now we imagine flattening the skeleton into a straight vertical line, and we redraw
the molecule using only straight lines for the groups:
This is our Fischer projection. All of the configurations can be seen on this drawing,
because we are able to picture in our minds what the 3D shape is. So the rule is that
all horizontal lines are coming out at us, and all vertical lines are going away from us:
You might be wondering how you would determine the configuration of a
stereocenter when you are given a Fischer projection. If each stereocenter is drawn
as two wedges and two dashes, how do you figure out how to look at the stereocenter?
The answer is simple. Just choose one dash and one wedge, and draw them

as straight lines. It doesn’t matter which ones you choose—you will get the answer
right regardless:
Once you have a drawing with two straight lines, one dash and one wedge, then you
should be able to determine whether the stereocenter is R or S. If you cannot, then
you should go back and review the section on assigning configuration.
Fischer projections can also be used for compounds with just one stereocenter,
as above, but they are usually used to show compounds with multiple stereocenters.
You will utilize Fischer projection heavily when you learn about carbohydrates at the
end of the course.
Now we can understand why we cannot draw a Fischer projection sideways. If
we did, we would be inverting the stereocenter. To draw the enantiomer of a Fischer
projection, do not turn the drawing sideways. Instead, you should use the second
method we saw for drawing enantiomers (place the mirror on the side of the compound
and draw the reflection). Recall that this was the method that we used for
drawings where wedges and dashes were implied but not shown. Fischer projections
are another example of drawings that fit this criterion:

Next, we choose one dash and one wedge, and we turn them into straight lines (it
doesn’t matter which dash or which wedge we choose):
Then we assign priorities based on atomic number:
The 4 is not on a dash, so we switch it with the 3 so it can be on a dash, and we see
that the configuration is S. Since we had to do a switch to get this, the configuration
of the original stereocenter (before the switch) was R:
Now, we need to draw the enantiomer. For Fischer projections, we use the method
where we place a mirror on the side, and then we draw the reflection:

7.8 OPTICAL ACTIVITY
Students confuse R/S with / all of the time, so let’s conclude our chapter by
clearing up the difference. Compounds are chiral if they have stereocenters and they
are not meso compounds. A chiral compound will have an enantiomer (a nonsuperimposable
mirror image). An interesting thing happens when you take a chiral compound
and subject it to plane-polarized light. The plane of the polarized light rotates
as it passes through the sample. If this rotation is clockwise, then we say the rotation
is . If the rotation is counterclockwise, then we say the rotation is . If we want
to refer to a racemic mixture (an equal mixture of both enantiomers), we will often
say (/) in the beginning of the name to mean that both enantiomers are present
in solution (and the rotations cancel each other).

7.8 OPTICAL ACTIVITY 163
Do not confuse clockwise rotation of plane-polarized light with clockwise ordering
of atomic numbers when determining configurations. They are not related.
When determining configuration, we impose a set of man-made rules to help us distinguish
between the two possible configurations. By using these rules, we will always
be able to communicate which configuration we are referring to, and we only
need one letter to communicate this (R or S) if we use the rules properly. However,
/ is totally different.
The rotation of plane polarized light (either  or ) is not a man-made convention.
It is a physical effect that is measured in the lab. It is impossible to predict
whether a compound will be  or  without actually going into the lab and trying.
If a stereocenter is R, this does not mean that the compound will be . It could just
as easily be . In fact, whether a compound is  or  will depend on temperature.
So a compound can be  at one temperature and  at another temperature. But
clearly, temperature has nothing to do with R and S. So, don’t confuse R/S with /.
They are totally independent and unrelated concepts.
You will never be expected to look at a compound that you have never seen
and then predict in which direction it will rotate plane-polarized light (unless you
know how the enantiomer rotates plane-polarized light, because enantiomers have
opposite effects). But you will be expected to assign configurations (R and S) for
stereocenters in compounds that you have never seen.
164 CHAPTER 7 CONFIGURATIONS
Mechanisms are your key to success in this course. If you can master the mechanisms,
you will do very well in this class. If you don’t master mechanisms, you will
do poorly in this class. What are mechanisms and why are they so important?
When two compounds react with each other to form new and different products,
we try to understand how the reaction occurred. Every reaction involves the
flow of electron density—electrons move to break bonds and form new bonds.
Mechanisms illustrate how the electrons move during a reaction. The flow of electrons
is shown with curved arrows; for example,
These arrows show us how the reaction took place. For most of the reactions
that you will see this semester, the mechanisms are well understood (although there
are some reactions whose mechanisms are still being debated today). You should
think of a mechanism as “bookkeeping of electrons.” Just as an accountant will do
the bookkeeping of a company’s cash flow (money coming in and money going out),
the mechanism of a reaction is the bookkeeping of the flow of electrons.
When you understand a mechanism, you will understand why the reaction
took place, why the stereocenters turned out the way they did, and so on. If you do
not understand the mechanism, then you will find yourself memorizing the exact details
of every single reaction. Unless you have a photographic memory, that will be
a very difficult challenge. By understanding mechanisms, you will be able to make
more sense of the course content, and you will be able to better organize all of the
reactions in your mind.
The mechanisms that you will learn in the first half of your course are the most
critical ones. This is the time when you will either master arrow pushing and mechanisms
or you will not master them. If you don’t, you will struggle with all mechanisms
in the rest of the course, which will turn your organic chemistry experience
into a nightmare. It is absolutely critical that you master the mechanisms for the
early reactions that you cover. That way, you will have the tools that you need to understand
all of the other mechanisms in your course.
In this chapter, we will not learn every mechanism that you need to know.
Rather, we will focus on the tools that you need to properly read a mechanism and abstract
the important information. You will learn some of the basic ideas behind arrow
pushing in mechanisms, and these ideas will help you conquer the early mechanisms

that you will learn. The second half of this chapter provides a place for you to keep a
list of mechanisms as you progress through the course. This list (which you will fill
out as you go along) is arranged so that you will have the key information at your fingertips,
and you will be able to use the list as a study guide for your exams.
8.1 CURVED ARROWS
We have already gotten quite a bit of experience with curved arrows in Chapter 2
(Resonance). There is one very major difference between curved arrows for drawing
resonance structures and curved arrows for drawing mechanisms. With resonance
structures, we saw that the electrons were not really moving at all. We were pretending
that they were moving so that we could draw all of the resonance structures.
By contrast, the curved arrows that we use in mechanisms refer to the actual movement
of electrons. Electrons are moving to break and form bonds (hence the term
chemical reaction). Why are we stressing this difference? We first need to understand
what arrows represent before we can move on to the rules of pushing arrows.
When we learned how to draw resonance structures, we saw two commandments
that we must not violate: (1) never break a single bond, and (2) never exceed
an octet for second-row elements. When drawing mechanisms, we are trying to understand
where the electrons actually moved to break and form bonds. Therefore, it
is OK to break single bonds. In fact, it happens in almost every reaction. So when
drawing mechanisms there is only one commandment to follow: never exceed an
octet for second-row elements.
Now that we have some of the ground rules down, let’s just have a quick review
of curved arrows, and the different types of arrows that you can draw. Every
curved arrow has a head and a tail. It is essential that the head and tail of every arrow
be drawn in precisely the proper place. The tail shows where the electrons are coming
from, and the head shows where the electrons are going:
Therefore, there are only two things that you have to get right when drawing each
arrow. The tail needs to be in the right place and the head needs to be in the right
place. Remember that electrons exist in orbitals, either as lone pairs or as bonds. So
the tail of an arrow can only come from a bond or from a lone pair: The head of an
arrow can only be drawn to make a bond or to make a lone pair: In total, this gives
us four possibilities:
1. Lone pair bond
2. Bond lone pair
3. Bond bond
4. Lone pair lone pair
The last possibility does not work, because we cannot push electrons from one lone
pair to another (at least not in one step). So we only have to consider the first three
Tail Head
166 CHAPTER 8 MECHANISMS
possibilities. Every arrow you will see will belong to one of these three categories,
so let’s see examples of each of the three categories.
From a Lone Pair to a Bond
Consider the following step, in which a single bond is formed:
The tail of the arrow is coming from a lone pair on the oxygen atom, and the head
of the arrow is going to form a bond between oxygen and carbon. Since the head of
the arrow is placed on an atom, it might seem like the electrons are going from a lone
pair to a lone pair, but they are not. The electrons are going from the oxygen lone
pair to form a bond to the carbon atom. If this makes you unhappy, there is an alternative
way of drawing the arrow that shows it more clearly:
The dotted line shows the bond that is about to form, and we draw the arrow to that
dotted line. In this drawing it is very clear that the head of the arrow is going to form
a bond. When you see an arrow drawn the first way (where it looks like it is going
to an atom rather than to form a bond), don’t be confused by this—it really is just
going to form a bond.
From a Bond to a Lone Pair
Now consider the following step, in which a single bond is broken:
The tail of the arrow is on a bond, and the head of the arrow is forming a lone
pair on the chlorine atom. The two electrons of the bond used to be shared between
the carbon atom and the chlorine atoms. But now, both electrons are going
on the chlorine atom. So carbon has lost an electron, and chlorine has gained
one. This is why carbon ends up with a positive charge, and chlorine gets a negative
charge.
By the way, a chlorine atom with a negative charge is called a chloride ion
(-ide- implies the negative charge). So, in this reaction, chloride leaves to generate a
carbocation (a carbon with a positive charge).

8.1 CURVED ARROWS 167
From a Bond to a Bond
Consider the first arrow in the example below, where we are using the electrons of
the pi bond to attack a proton (H), and expelling Cl in the process:
The first arrow has its tail on the pi bond, and the head is being used to form a bond
between a carbon atom and the proton.
You will notice in the example above that there are two arrows. The first arrow
is going from a bond to a bond. But the second arrow is going from a bond to form
a lone pair. So we see that you can have more than one type of arrow together in one
step of a mechanism.
In fact, it is possible to have all three types of arrows in one step of a mechanism.
Consider the example below:
Notice that there is one long flow of electron density, illustrated with three arrows. We
begin at the tail of the arrow on the base, because that is where the flow starts. This
arrow is going from a lone pair to form a bond. The second arrow goes from a bond
to form a bond, and the third arrow goes from a bond to form a lone pair on X. This
type of reaction is called an elimination reaction, because we are eliminating H and
X to form a double bond:
Notice that the arrows are all going from one end of the molecule to the other. Never
draw arrows going in opposite directions. That would not make any sense! To see
what we mean by this, consider the example below:

168 CHAPTER 8 MECHANISMS
This type of reaction will be covered much later on in your course, but let’s use it
now as an example. In the first step, we have two arrows: from a lone pair to form a
bond, and then from a bond to form a lone pair:
In the second step of the mechanism, we also have two arrows: from a lone pair to
form a bond, and then from a bond to form a lone pair:
If we consider the overall reaction, we notice that the HO is replacing the Cl. If we
look at how the electrons flowed, we see that it all started at the negative charge of the
attacking HO. This charge flowed up temporarily on to the oxygen atom of the C¨O
in step 1 of the mechanism, and then the charge flowed back down to expel Cl:
When we consider how the charge flowed throughout the whole reaction, it might be
tempting to draw it all in one step, like this:

8.1 CURVED ARROWS 169
Never draw arrows in opposite directions. That would imply that the electrons were
flowing in opposite directions at the same time. That is not possible. In this reaction,
the electrons first flowed up, and then they flowed back down. So we have to draw it
as two steps:
Before we can practice drawing arrows, we first need to make sure that we can
identify the three different arrow types. This is important, because it will get you accustomed
to the types of arrows that are acceptable to draw.
EXERCISE 8.1 In the example below, classify each arrow that you see into one
of the following three types:
1. Bond bond
2. Bond lone pair
3. Or lone pair  bond
Answer The first arrow is going from a lone pair on the sulfur atom to form a
bond between sulfur and carbon. So, this arrow is of the type: lone pair  bond.
The second arrow is going from a bond to form a lone pair, so the second
arrow is of the type: bond  lone pair.

into one of the three types that we discussed.

8.2 ARROW PUSHING
Now that we know what kinds of arrows are acceptable, we can begin to practice
drawing them (or “pushing” them, as its called). To do this, we need to learn how to
analyze a step in a mechanism, and train our eyes to look for all of the lone pairs and
all of the bonds. We have said that all arrows are coming from or going to either lone
pairs or bonds. So it makes sense that we need to be able to look at a step in a mechanism
and determine which bonds have changed and which lone pairs have changed.
Let’s see this in an example.
EXERCISE 8.8 Complete the mechanism of the following reaction by drawing
the proper arrows in each step:
Answer We need to look for all changes for bonds or lone pairs. In the first step,
the double bond is disappearing, one of the carbon atoms of the double bond is forming
a new bond to a proton (H), and we are breaking the HˆCl bond to expel Cl.
So we have broken two bonds (C¨C, and HˆCl) and we have formed one bond
(CˆH) and one extra lone pair (on Cl). Therefore, we will need two arrows to make
this happen. Where do we start?
Keep in mind that electron density always flows in one direction. In this example
we can see which direction the flow went, because a positive charge was
formed on the carbon atom, and a negative charge developed on chlorine. We can use
that information to figure out the direction of the flow. The first arrow needs to show
the double bond going to form a bond to the proton (from a bond to a bond) and then
we need a second arrow to show the bond from the HˆCl going to form a negative
charge on the chlorine atom (from a bond to a lone pair):

8.2 ARROW PUSHING 171
In the next step, again we look for all changes to lone pairs or bonds. We see that the
Cl is giving up one of its lone pairs to form a bond with a carbon (C). So, we need
only one arrow, from a lone pair to form a bond:

the proper arrows.

172 CHAPTER 8 MECHANISMS
Remember that arrows indicate the flow of electrons. Arrows do not show where
atoms went. Many students will accidentally draw it like this:
Students often make this mistake because they want to show where the H is going.
But this is wrong. Remember that arrows show the movement of electrons, not
atoms. The H was able to move only because the electrons came from the oxygen
atom and grabbed the H.
8.3 DRAWING INTERMEDIATES
We have seen the different types of arrows and how to draw them. Now we need to
get practice drawing intermediates when we are given the arrows. Intermediates are
structures that exist for a very short time before reacting further. Let’s consider an
analogy. Imagine that you are trying to climb a mountain and it is very cold (below
freezing). You are wearing a hat that keeps your ears warm, but it is loose and keeps
slipping off. Your friend offers you a spare hat that he brought, and you borrow it.
Now you need to take your old hat off to replace it with the new hat. If someone were
to take a picture of you while you have nothing on your head, the picture would look
very strange. There you are, in the freezing cold, with no hat on. You were only like
that for 3 seconds, but it was long enough for someone to take a picture. Intermediates
of reactions are similar.
Intermediates are intermediate structures in going from the starting material to
the product. They do not live for very long, and it is rare that you can isolate one and
store it in a bottle, but they do exist for very short periods of time. Their structures
are often critical in understanding the next step of the reaction. Going back to the
analogy, if I saw the picture of you without your hat on, and I knew how cold it was
on that mountain, then I would have been able to predict that you put on a hat right
after the picture was taken. I would have known this because I would have been able
to immediately identify an uncomfortable situation, and I could have predicted what
resolution must have taken place to alleviate the problem. The same is true of intermediates.
If we can look at an intermediate and determine which part of the intermediate
is unstable, and we also know what options are available to alleviate the
instability, then we can predict the products of the reaction based on an analysis of
the intermediate. That’s why they are so important.
So let’s get practice drawing intermediates. If you look closely at any step of
a mechanism, you will see that the arrows tell you exactly how to draw the intermediate.
Since you know how to classify every arrow into one of three categories
Bad arrow

H
Me H
O
H
8.3 DRAWING INTERMEDIATES 173
(previous section of this chapter), now you will be able to read each arrow as a road
map of how to draw the intermediate. Here’s an example:
Let’s read the arrows. The first arrow is from a lone pair to form a bond. The
arrow shows electrons in a lone pair on a nucleophile (a structure that is electron
rich) forming a bond with a carbon atom. The second arrow is from a bond to a bond.
The third arrow goes from a bond to form a lone pair. All in all, these arrows serve
as a road map for drawing the intermediate:
The trickiest part is getting the formal charges correct. If you have trouble assigning
formal charges, then you will need to go back and review the sections on
formal charges in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of this book. Assigning formal charges
is a very important part of drawing the intermediates. Drawing the structure without
the charges would be like taking the photograph in the analogy above, but digitally
removing all of the snow. Without the snow, I wouldn’t know that it was cold,
so I would not be able to predict that you put a hat on shortly after the picture was
taken. If you don’t draw the source of instability on the intermediate, then what
good is it?
One trick will help you in some situations when you have a flow of electrons
represented by a few arrows (as in the example above). Notice that the only
change in formal charges comes on the first and last atom of the system where
the electrons are flowing. In our example above, the nucleophile loses its negative
charge by using its lone pair to form a bond with a carbon atom. At the other
end of the system, oxygen is gaining a negative charge as a bond is converted
into a lone pair on oxygen. Notice the conservation of charge. If the overall
charge is negative at the beginning of the reaction, then it must also be negative
at the end of the reaction. If something starts off with no charge, then it can split
up into a positive charge and a negative charge, because the total charge is still
conserved.

get after pushing the arrows:

174 CHAPTER 8 MECHANISMS
Answer We need to read the arrows like a road map: the first arrow is going from
a lone pair on HO to form a bond with the carbon atom of the C¨O. The second
arrow goes from the C¨O bond to form a lone pair on oxygen. We use this info to
draw the resulting intermediate:
The hard part was assigning formal charges. Notice that we had two arrows moving
in a flow. We had a negative charge in the beginning, so we must have a negative
charge in the end. It started off on the first atom in the flow of arrows, and it ended
on the last atom of the flow (oxygen).

8.4 NUCLEOPHILES AND ELECTROPHILES
Whenever one compound uses its electrons to attack another compound, we call the
attacker a nucleophile, and we call the compound being attacked an electrophile. It
is very simple to tell the difference between an electrophile and a nucleophile. You
just look at the arrows and see which compound is attacking the other. A nucleophile
will always use a region of high electron density (either a lone pair or a bond) to attack
the electrophile (which, by definition, has a region of low electron density that
can be attacked). These are important terms, so let’s make sure we know how to
identify nucleophiles and electrophiles.
EXERCISE 8.20 In the reaction below, determine which compound is the nucleophile
and which compound is the electrophile:

8.5 BASES VERSUS NUCLEOPHILES
Students are often unclear about the difference between nucleophiles and bases.
Since most mechanisms involve the use of nucleophiles and bases, it will be worth
our time to clear up the difference.
Consider the hydroxide ion (HO). Sometimes it acts like a base and removes
a proton from another compound:
At other times it acts like a nucleophile and attacks another compound (forming a
new bond to an atom in that compound):
The difference between basicity and nucleophilicity is a difference of function. In
other words, the hydroxide ion can function in two ways: as a base (which means it
is pulling off a proton and then running away with that proton) or as a nucleophile
(latching onto a compound). In some cases, the hydroxide ion might function mostly
as a base; while in other situations, the hydroxide ion might function mostly as a nucleophile.
To understand mechanisms well, it is important to be able to distinguish
between the two roles. Let’s see an example.

8.31 Answer:
PROBLEMS In each step below, determine whether water is functioning as a
nucleophile or as a base.
8.32 Answer:
8.33 Answer:
There is another subtle difference between nucleophiles and bases that is worth mentioning,
because it illustrates a common theme in organic chemistry. We can see the
difference by defining the terms nucleophilicity and basicity.
Once we determine that a reagent is acting as a nucleophile, we measure how
fast it functions that way with the term nucleophilicity. Nucleophilicity measures
how quickly a reagent will attack another compound. For example, we saw above
that water can function as a nucleophile because it has lone pairs that can attack a
compound. But the hydroxide ion will clearly be more nucleophilic—the hydroxide
ion has a negative charge, so it will attack compounds faster.
Basicity measures base strength (or how unstable the base is) by the position
of equilibrium. The term basicity does not reflect how quickly the equilibrium was
reached. The equilibrium might have been established in a fraction of a second or it
could have taken several hours. It doesn’t matter, because we are not measuring
speed of reaction. We are measuring stability and the position of the equilibrium.
Now we can understand the difference between nucleophilicity and basicity.
Nucleophilicity measures how fast things happen, which is called kinetics. Basicity
measures stability and the position of equilibrium, which is called thermodynamics.
Throughout your course, you will see many reactions where the product is determined
by kinetic concepts, and you will also see many reactions where the product
is determined by thermodynamic concepts. In fact, there will even be times where
these two factors are competing with each other and you will need to make a choice
of which factor wins: kinetics or thermodynamics.
So the difference between nucleophiles and bases is a difference of function.
And now we can also appreciate that nucleophilicity is a measure of a kinetic phenomenon
(rate of reaction), while basicity is a measure of stability (thermodynamic
phenomenon).

8.6 THE REGIOCHEMISTRY IS
CONTAINED WITHIN THE MECHANISM
Regiochemistry refers to where the reaction takes place. In other words, in what region
of the molecule is the reaction taking place? Let’s see examples of this for different
types of reactions. In the process, we will uncover some new terminology as
we learn about different reactions.
Let’s consider elimination reactions. When we eliminate H and X (where X
is some leaving group that can leave with a negative charge, like Cl or Br), it is
possible to form the double bond in different locations. Consider the following
compound:
This compound can undergo two possible elimination reactions (to make it easier to
see, we are drawing the H that gets eliminated in each case, even though we usually
do not draw hydrogen atoms on bond-line drawings):
Where does the double bond form? This is a question of regiochemistry. We distinguish
between these two possibilities by considering how many groups are attached
to each double bond. Double bonds can have anywhere from 1 to 4 groups attached
to them:
So if we look back at the reaction above, we find that the two possible products are
monosubstituted and disubstituted double bonds. Whenever we have an elimination
reaction where more than one possible double bond can be formed, we have names
for the different products based on which one is more substituted and which one is
less substituted. The more substituted product is called the Zaitsev product, and the
Monosubstituted Disubstituted Trisubstituted Tetrasubstituted

less substituted product is called the Hoffmann product. Usually, we get the Zaitsev
product, but under special circumstances we get the Hoffman product. You will learn
about this in detail in your textbook when you cover elimination reactions. For now,
you just need to realize that this is an issue of regiochemistry. The difference between
the Zaitsev product and the Hoffman has to do with where the double bond
formed. This is regiochemistry.
Let’s consider another example of regiochemistry, in a completely different
type of reaction. Consider the addition reaction of HCl across a double bond:
There are two possible ways to add the H and the Cl. Which product do we get?
One possibility would be to put the Cl on the less substituted carbon (carbon
connected to two other carbon atoms), and the other possibility would be to put
the Cl on the more substituted carbon (carbon connected to three other carbon
atoms). If we put the Cl on the more substituted carbon, we call this a Markovnikov
addition. If we put the Cl on the less substituted carbon, we call it an anti-
Markovnikov addition. How do we know whether we get Markovnikov addition or
anti-Markovnikov addition? This is an issue of regiochemistry.
For the reaction above, let’s analyze the two possible outcomes. In each case,
the first step involves the electrons of the double bond attacking the proton of HCl
to form a carbocation (a carbon with a positive charge). The difference between the
two possibilities is where the carbocation is formed:

8.6 THE REGIOCHEMISTRY IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE MECHANISM 181
Recall that alkyl groups are electron donating, so the carbocation on the bottom
(called a tertiary carbocation because it has three alkyl groups) will be more stable
than the carbocation on the top (called a secondary carbocation because it has only
two alkyl groups).
Therefore, possibility 2 is a better mechanism (because it involves a more stable intermediate.
If we follow the last step of the mechanism for possibility 2, we see that
the Cl will attach where the carbocation is, which will be at the more substituted
carbon:
We see that the final position of chlorine is determined by the stability of the
intermediate carbocation, which becomes evident as we work through the mechanism.
Since chlorine ends up at the more substituted carbon, we call this a
Markovnikov addition. The mechanism for this reaction helped explain the regiochemistry
of the reaction.
Sometimes regiochemistry is not an issue. For example, if we are adding H
and H across a double bond, then it does not matter which carbon gets the first H and
which carbon gets the second H. Either way, they both end up with an H. Similarly,
if we add two OH groups across a double bond, regiochemistry also does not matter.
Any time we add two of the same group across a double bond, we do not have
to worry about the regiochemistry.
Here is where we get back to mechanisms. Whether we are talking about
Zaitsev vs. Hoffman elimination reactions or about Markovnikov vs. anti-
Markovnikov addition reactions, the explanation of the regiochemistry for every
reaction is contained within the mechanism. If we completely understand the mechanism,
then we will understand why the regiochemistry had to be the way it turned
out. By understanding the mechanism, we eliminate the need to memorize the
regiochemistry for every reaction. With every reaction you encounter, you should
consider the regiochemistry of the reaction and look at the mechanism for an explanation
of the regiochemistry.
PROBLEMS You will, over the course of your studies, learn mechanisms for the
following reactions. In the meantime, you will be given the regiochemical information
that you need to answer each of the problems below. These problems are intended
to ensure that you understand what regiochemistry means.

8.34 Consider the reaction shown. If you were to add HBr across the double bond,
what would the product be? Assume a Markovnikov addition.
8.35 When you do the same reaction (as above) in the presence of peroxides
(R-O-O-R), you get an anti-Markovnikov addition of HBr across the double bond.
Draw the product of an anti-Markovnikov addition.
8.36 Consider the elimination reaction below, which uses a strong base. The product
will be a double bond. This reaction will produce two Zaitsev products. One will
be cis and one will be trans. Draw these products, and identify which is cis and
which is trans.
8.37 Consider the elimination reaction below, which uses a strong, sterically hindered
base (LDA). The product will be a double bond. This reaction will produce the
Hoffmann product. Draw this product.
8.7 THE STEREOCHEMISTRY IS
CONTAINED WITHIN THE MECHANISM
Stereochemistry is all about configurations of stereocenters (R vs. S) and double
bonds (E vs. Z). Whenever we have a reaction where we are forming a stereocenter,
we need to ask whether we get a racemic mixture (equal amounts of R and S)
or only one configuration. And, if so, why? Also, whenever we form a double bond,
we need to ask whether we get both E and Z isomers or only one of them? And, if
so, why?
Whenever a mechanism is proposed to explain a reaction, the proposed mechanism
must explain the observed stereochemical outcome of the reaction. Therefore,

if you understand the accepted mechanism, then you will not have to memorize the
stereochemical outcome. It will simply make sense. Let’s see an example. Consider
the addition of Br and Br across a double bond. We already saw that we don’t need
to worry about the regiochemistry of this reaction, because we are adding two of the
same group. But what about the stereochemistry? We are creating two new stereocenters:
Each stereocenter has two possibilities (R or S). Since there are two stereocenters,
we will have four total possibilitites: SR, RS, RR, and SS. These four compounds represent
two sets of enantiomers:
How many of them do we get? Do we get both sets of enantiomers as our
products (meaning all four products), or do we only get one set (meaning two out
of the four possible products)? This depends on how the reaction took place.
If an addition reaction can take place only through a mechanism that allows
a syn addition, then the two groups must be added across the same side of the double
bond. So we will get only that one set of enantiomers:
If a reaction can go through only an anti addition, then the two groups must be added
across opposite sides of the double bond. So we will get only the set of enantiomers
where the groups are on opposite sides:

184 CHAPTER 8 MECHANISMS
Sometimes, the reaction is not stereoselective. In other words, we get both syn and
anti addition. So we get all four products (both sets of enantiomers).
Each reaction will be different. Some will give only syn addition, some will
give only anti addition, and others will not be stereospecific. For every addition
reaction, we need to know the stereochemistry of the addition, and that information
is contained within the mechanism.
So let’s go back to our example above with the addition of Br and Br across a
double bond. This reaction is an anti addition, so we get only the set of enantiomers
that has the two Br groups on opposite sides of the ring:
Let’s look at the mechanism to understand why. In the first step, we form a bridged
intermediate, called a bromonium ion:
In this step, the double bond is acting as a nucleophile that attacks Br2 (the electrophile
in this reaction). The arrows are not going in opposite directions—they are
actually moving in a small circle to form a ring.
Then, in the next step, the bromide (formed in the first step) comes back and
attacks the bromonium ion, opening up the bridge. The bromide can attack either
carbon (both possibilities shown below):
When the bromide attacks, it must attack on the other side of the ring (not the side
of the bromonium bridge, but rather on the opposite side of the ring) to break open
the bridge. So the addition must be an anti addition.
We see that the mechanism explains why the addition must be anti. For every
reaction, the stereochemistry will always be explained by the mechanism.

PROBLEM 8.38 In the reaction above, we saw that the first step involved formation
of a bromonium ion.
You will notice that the bromonium ion has the bridge coming out toward you (on
wedges), but we did not say at the time that it could also have formed with the bridge
going away from you (on dashes):
We did not talk about this at the time, because the end products would still have been
the same as the way we did it before. Draw what happens if bromide (Br) attacks
this other bromonium ion. Remember that there are two carbon atoms that bromide
could attack, so draw both possibilities:
When you finish drawing the two products, compare them to the two products that
we got before. You should find that the two products you get here are the same as
the two products we got before. Think about why. Remember that the reaction can
happen only as an anti addition.
Every new class of reactions (additions, eliminations, substitutions, etc.) has
its own terminology for stereochemistry. As you learn each of these classes of reactions,
keep a watchful eye on what terminology is used to describe the stereochemistry.
Then, look at the mechanism of each reaction within each class, and try to
understand how the mechanism explains the stereochemistry.

PROBLEMS Over the course of your studies, you will learn mechanisms for each
of the following reactions. In the meantime, you will be given the stereochemical
information that you need to answer each of the following problems. These problems
are intended to ensure that you understand what stereochemistry means.
8.39 If you add OH and OH across the following double bond in a syn addition,
what will the products be?
8.40 If you add Br and Br across the following double bond in an anti addition,
what will the products be?
8.41 If you add Br and Br across the following double bond in an anti addition,
you get only one product. If you draw the two products that you would expect, you
will find that they are the same compound (a meso compound). Draw this product.
Do not confuse the concepts of regiochemistry and stereochemistry. For instance,
in addition reactions, the term “anti-Markovnikov addition” refers to the regiochemistry
of the addition, but the term “anti” refers to the stereochemistry of the
addition. Students often confuse these concepts (probably because both terms have
the word “anti”). It is possible for an addition reaction to be anti-Markovnikov and
a syn addition (hydroboration is an example that you will learn about at some point
in time). You must realize that regiochemistry and stereochemistry are two totally
different concepts.
8.42 In the following reaction, we will add H and OH across a double bond. The
regiochemistry is anti-Markovnikov, and the stereochemistry is a syn addition. Draw

8.8 A LIST OF MECHANISMS
Now you need to begin to keep a list of all reaction mechanisms that you cover. The
rest of the pages in this chapter are set up specifically for you to generate this list in
such a way that you will record the critical information: the regiochemistry and the
stereochemistry. You should fill in these pages as you proceed through the course
and you learn more mechanisms. As your list gets larger, you will have one central
place where you can go to review all of the mechanisms.
A few example mechanisms have been filled in for you, so that you can see
how to fill in each mechanism from now on. Depending on the order that your course
follows, these reactions may or may not be the first ones you cover. Whatever the
case might be, you will definitely see these reactions early on in the course:

In the last chapter we saw the importance of understanding mechanisms. We said
that mechanisms are the keys to understanding everything else. In this chapter, we
will see a very special case of this. Students often have difficulty with substitution
reactions—specifically, being able to predict whether a reaction is an SN2 or an SN1.
These are different types of substitution reactions and their mechanisms are very different
from each other. By focusing on the differences in their mechanisms, we can
understand why we get SN2 in some cases and SN1 in other cases.
Four factors are used to determine which reaction takes place. These four factors
make perfect sense when we understand the mechanisms. So, it makes sense to
start off with the mechanisms.
9.1 THE MECHANISMS
Ninety-five percent of the reactions that we see in organic chemistry occur between
a nucleophile and an electrophile. A nucleophile is a compound that either is negatively
charged or has a region of high electron density (like a lone pair or a double
bond). An electrophile is a compound that either is positively charged or has a region
of low electron density. When a nucleophile encounters an electrophile, a reaction
can occur.
In both SN2 and SN1 reactions, a nucleophile is attacking an electrophile, giving
a substitution reaction. That explains the SN part of the name. But what do the
“1” and “2” stand for? To see this, we need to look at the mechanisms. Let’s start
with SN2:
On the left, we see a nucleophile. It is attacking a compound that has an electrophilic
carbon atom that is attached to a leaving group (LG). A leaving group is
any group that can be expelled (we will see examples of this very soon). The leaving
group serves two important functions: 1) it withdraws electron density from
the carbon atom to which it is attached, rendering the carbon atom electrophilic,
and 2) it is capable of stabilizing the negative charge after being expelled.

CHAPTER9
SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS
An SN2 mechanism employs two curved arrows: one going from a lone pair on
the nucleophile to form a bond between the nucleophile and carbon, and the other
going from the bond between the carbon atom and the LG to form a lone pair on the
LG. Notice that the configuration at the carbon atom gets inverted in this reaction.
So the stereochemistry of this reaction is inversion of configuration. Why does this
happen? It is kind of like an umbrella flipping in a strong wind. It takes a good force
to do it, but it is possible to flip the umbrella. The same is true here. If the nucleophile
is good enough, and if all of the other conditions are just right, a reaction can
take place in which the configuration of the stereocenter is inverted (by bringing the
nucleophile in on one side, and kicking off the LG on the other side).
Now we get to the meaning of “2” in SN2. Remember from the last chapter
that nucleophilicity is a measure of kinetics (how fast something happens). Since this
is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, then we care about how fast the reaction is
happening. In other words, what is the rate of the reaction? This mechanism has only
one step, and in that step, two things need to find each other: the nucleophile and the
electrophile. So it makes sense that the rate of the reaction will be dependent on how
much electrophile is around and how much nucleophile is around. In other words,
the rate of the reaction is dependent on the concentrations of two entities. The reaction
is said to be “second order,” and we signify this by placing a “2” in the name of
the reaction.
Now let’s look at the mechanism for an SN1 reaction:
In this reaction, there are two steps. The first step has the LG leaving all by itself,
without any help from an attacking nucleophile. This generates a carbocation, which
then gets attacked by the nucleophile in step 2. This is the major difference between
SN2 and SN1 reactions. In SN2 reactions, everything happens in one step. In SN1
reactions, it happens in two steps, and we are forming a carbocation in the process.
The existence of the carbocation as an intermediate in only the SN1 mechanism is the
key. By understanding this, we can understand everything else.
For example, let’s look at the stereochemistry of SN1 reactions. We already
saw that SN2 reactions proceed via inversion of configuration. But SN1 reactions are
very different. Recall that a carbocation is sp2 hybridized, so its geometry is trigonal
planar. When the nucleophile attacks, there is no preference as to which side it can
attack, and we get both possible configurations in equal amounts. Half of the molecules
would have one configuration and the other half would have the other configuration.
We learned before that this is called a racemic mixture. Notice that we can
explain the stereochemical outcome of this reaction by understanding the nature of
the carbocation intermediate that is formed.
This also allows us to understand why we have the “1” in SN1. There are two
steps in this reaction. The first step is very slow (the LG just leaves on its own to

210 CHAPTER 9 SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS
form C and LG), and the second step is very fast. Therefore, the rate of the second
step is irrelevant. Let’s use an analogy to understand this.
Imagine that you have an hourglass with two openings that the sand had to
pass by:
The first opening is much smaller, and the sand can travel through this opening
only at a certain speed. The size of the second opening doesn’t really matter. If
you made the second opening a little bit wider, it would not help the sand get to the
bottom any faster. As long as the top opening is smaller, the rate of the falling sand
will depend only on the size of the top opening.
The same is true in a two-step reaction. If the first step is slow and the second
step is fast, then the speed of the second step is irrelevant. The rate of product formation
will depend only on the rate of the first step (the slow step). So in our SN1
reaction, the first step is the slow step (loss of the LG to form the carbocation) and
the second step is fast (nucleophile attacking the carbocation). Just as we saw in the
hourglass, the second step of our mechanism will not affect the rate of the reaction.
Notice that the nucleophile does not appear in the mechanism until the second step.
If we added more nucleophile, it would not affect the rate of the first step. Adding
more nucleophile would only speed up the second step. But we already saw that the
rate of the second step does not matter for the overall reaction rate. Speeding up the
second step will not change anything. So the concentration of nucleophile does not
affect the rate of the reaction.
Of course, it is important that we have a nucleophile present, but how much we
have doesn’t matter. So now we can understand the “1” in SN1. The rate of the reaction
is dependent only on the concentration of the electrophile, and not that of the nucleophile.
The rate is dependent on the concentration of only one entity, and the reaction
is said to be “first order.” We signify this by placing a “1” in the name. Of course, this
does not mean that you only need the electrophile. You still need the nucleophile for
the reaction to happen. You still need two different things (nucleophile and electrophile).
The “1” simply means that the rate is not dependent on the concentration of
both of them. The rate is dependent on the concentration of only one of them.
The mechanisms of SN1 and SN2 reactions helped us understand the stereochemistry
of each reaction, and we were also able to see why we call them SN1 and
SN2 reactions (based on reaction rates that are justified by the mechanisms). So, the
mechanisms really do explain a lot. This should make sense, because a proposed
First opening
Second opening
9.1 THE MECHANISMS 211
mechanism must successfully explain the experimental observations. So, of course
the mechanism explains the reason for racemization in an SN1 process. That is what
makes the mechanism plausible.
We mentioned before that we need to consider four factors when choosing
whether a reaction will go by an SN1 or SN2 mechanism. These four factors are: electrophile,
nucleophile, leaving group, and solvent. We will go through each factor one
at a time, and we will see that the difference between the two mechanisms is the key
to understanding each of these four factors. Before we move on, it is very important
that you understand the two mechanisms. For practice, try to draw them in the space
below without looking back to see them again.
Remember, an SN2 mechanism has one step: the nucleophile attacks the electrophile,
expelling the leaving group. An SN1 mechanism has two steps: first the
leaving group leaves to form a carbocation, and then the nucleophile attacks that carbocation.
Also remember that SN2 involves inversion of configuration, while SN1 involves
racemization. Now, try to draw them.
SN2:
SN1:
9.2 FACTOR 1—THE ELECTROPHILE (SUBSTRATE)
The electrophile is the compound being attacked by the nucleophile. In substitution
and elimination reactions (which we will see in the next chapter), we generally refer
to the electrophile as the substrate.
Remember that carbon has four bonds. So, other than the bond to the leaving
group, the carbon atom that we are attacking has three other bonds:
The question is, how many of these groups are alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, propyl,
etc.)? We represent alkyl groups with the letter “R.” If there is one alkyl group, we call
the substrate “primary” (1°). If there are two alkyl groups, we call the substrate “secondary”
(2°). And if there are three alkyl groups, we call the substrate “tertiary” (3°):
LG

3
212 CHAPTER 9 SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS
In an SN2 reaction, alkyl groups make it very crowded at the electrophilic
center where the nucleophile needs to attack. If there are three alkyl groups, then it
is virtually impossible for the nucleophile to get in and attack (this is an argument
based on sterics):
So, for SN2 reactions, 1° is better, 2° is OK, and 3° rarely happens.
But SN1 reactions are totally different. The first step is not attack of the nucleophile.
The first step is loss of the leaving group to form the carbocation. Then the
nucleophile attacks the carbocation. Remember that carbocations are trigonal planar,
so it doesn’t matter how big the groups are. The groups go out into the plane, so it
is easy for the nucleophile to attack. Sterics is not a problem.
In SN1 reactions, the stability of the carbocation is the paramount issue. Recall
that alkyl groups are electron donating. Therefore, 3° is best because the three alkyl
groups stabilize the carbocation. 1° is the worst because there is only one alkyl group
to stabilize the carbocation. This has nothing to do with sterics; this is an argument
of electronics (stability of charge). So we have two opposite trends, for completely
different reasons:
These charts show the rate of reaction. If you have a 1° substrate, then the reaction
will proceed via an SN2 mechanism, with inversion of configuration. If you have a
3° substrate, then the reaction will proceed via an SN1 mechanism, with racemization.
What do you do if the substrate is 2°? You move on to factor 2.

9.4 9.5
There is one other way to stabilize a carbocation (other than alkyl groups)—
resonance. If a carbocation is resonance stabilized, then it will be easier to form that
carbocation:
The carbocation above is stabilized by resonance. Therefore, the LG is willing to
leave, and we can have an SN1 reaction.
There are two kinds of systems that you should learn to recognize: a LG in a
benzylic position and a LG in an allylic position. Compounds like this will be resonance
stabilized when the LG leaves:
If you see a double bond near the LG and you are not sure if it is a benzylic or
allylic system, just draw the carbocation you would get and see if there are any
resonance structures.

9.3 FACTOR 2 – THE NUCLEOPHILE
The rate of an SN2 process is dependent on the strength of the nucleophile. A strong
nucleophile will speed up the rate of an SN2 reaction, while a weak nucleophile will
slow down the rate of an SN2 reaction. In contrast, an SN1 process is not affected by

the strength of the nucleophile. Why not? Recall that the “1” in SN1 means that the rate
of reaction is dependent only on the substrate, not on the nucleophile (remember the
hourglass analogy). The concentration of the nucleophile is not relevant in determining
the rate of reaction. Similarly, the strength of the nucleophile is also not relevant.
In summary, the nucleophile has the following effect on the competition between
SN2 and SN1:
• A strong nucleophile favors SN2.
• A weak nucleophile disfavors SN2 (and thereby allows SN1 to compete
successfully).
We must therefore learn to identify nucleophiles as strong or weak. The strength of
a nucleophile is determined by many factors, such as the presence or absence of a
negative charge. For example, hydroxide (HO) and water (H2O) are both nucleophiles,
because in both cases, the oxygen atom has lone pairs. But hydroxide is a
stronger nucleophile since it has a negative charge.
Charge is not the only factor that determines the strength of a nucleophile. In
fact, there is a more important factor, called polarizability, which describes the ability
of an atom or molecule to distribute its electron density unevenly in response
to external influences. For example, sulfur is highly polarizable, because its electron
density can be unevenly distributed when it comes near an electrophile. Polarizability
is directly related to the size of the atom (and more specifically, the number
of electrons that are distant from the nucleus). Sulfur is very large and has many
electrons that are distant from the nucleus, and it is therefore highly polarizable.
Iodine shares the same feature. As a result, I and HS are particularly strong
nucleophiles. For similar reasons, H2S is also a strong nucleophile, despite the fact
that it lacks a negative charge.
Below are some strong and weak nucleophiles that we will encounter often:

9.4 FACTOR 3 – THE LEAVING GROUP
Both SN1 and SN2 mechanisms are sensitive to the identity of the leaving group. If
the leaving group is bad, then neither mechanism can operate, but SN1 reactions
are generally more sensitive to the leaving group than SN2 reactions. Why? Recall
that the rate-determining step of an SN1 process is loss of a leaving group to form
a carbocation and a leaving group:
We have already seen that the rate of this step is very sensitive to the stability of the
carbocation, so it should make sense that it is also sensitive to the stability of the leaving
group. The leaving group must be highly stabilized in order for an SN1 process to
be effective.
What determines the stability of a leaving group? As a general rule, good
leaving groups are the conjugate bases of strong acids. For example, iodide (I) is
the conjugate base of a very strong acid (HI):

Iodide is a very weak base because it is highly stabilized. As a result, iodide
can function as a good leaving group. In fact, iodide is one of the best leaving
groups. The following figure shows a list of good leaving groups, all of which are
the conjugate bases of strong acids:
In contrast, hydroxide is a bad leaving group, because it is not a stabilized base. In
fact, hydroxide is a relatively strong base, and, therefore, it rarely functions as a
leaving group. It is a bad leaving group. But under certain circumstances, it is possible
to convert a bad leaving group into a good leaving group. For example, when
treated with a strong acid, an OH group is protonated, converting it into a good
leaving group:

The most commonly used leaving groups are halides and sulfonate ions:
Among the halides, iodide is the best leaving group because it is a weaker base
(more stable) than bromide or chloride. Among the sulfonate ions, the best leaving
group is the triflate group, but the most commonly used is the tosylate group. It is
abbreviated as OTs. When you see OTs connected to a compound, you should recognize
the presence of a good leaving group.
EXERCISE 9.18 Identify the leaving group in the following compound:
ANSWER We have seen that hydroxide is not a good leaving group, because its
conjugate acid (H2O) is not a strong acid. As a result, hydroxide is not a weak base,
so it does not function as a leaving group. In contrast, chloride is a good leaving
group because its conjugate acid (HCl) is a strong acid. Therefore, chloride is a weak
base, so it can serve as a leaving group.

an SN1 reaction, using 3-ethyl-3-pentanol as the substrate, what reagent would you
use to change the leaving group into a better leaving group and provide chloride ions
at the same time?
9.5 FACTOR 4—THE SOLVENT
So far, we have explored the substrate, the nucleophile, and the leaving group. This
takes care of all of the parts of the compounds that are reacting with each other. Let’s
summarize substitution reactions in a way that allows us to see this:
So, by talking about the substrate, the nucleophile, and the leaving group, we
have covered almost everything. But there is one more thing to take into account.
What solvent are these compounds dissolved in? It can make a difference. Let’s
see how.
There is a really strong solvent effect that greatly affects the competition between
SN1 and SN2, and here it is: polar aprotic solvents favor SN2 reactions. So,
what are polar aprotic solvents, and why do they favor SN2 reactions?
Let’s break it down into two parts: polar and aprotic. Hopefully, you remember
from general chemistry what the term “polar” means, and you should also

220 CHAPTER 9 SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS
remember that “like dissolves like” (so polar solvents dissolve polar compounds,
and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar compounds). Therefore, we really need
a polar solvent to run substitution reactions. SN1 desperately needs the polar solvent
to stabilize the carbocation, and SN2 needs a polar solvent to dissolve the
nucleophile. SN1 certainly needs the polar solvent more than SN2 does, but you
will rarely see a substitution reaction in a nonpolar solvent. So, let’s focus on the
term aprotic.
Let’s begin by defining a protic solvent. We will need to jog our memories
about acid–base chemistry. Recall that in Chapter 3 we talked about the acidity of
protons (these are hydrogen atoms without the electrons, symbolized by H), and we
saw that protons can be removed from a compound if the compound can stabilize the
negative charge that develops when H is removed. A protic solvent is a solvent that
has a proton connected to an electronegative atom (for example, H2O or EtOH). It is
called protic because the solvent can serve as a source of protons. In other words, the
solvent can give a proton because the solvent can stabilize a negative charge (at least
a little bit). So what is an aprotic solvent?
Aprotic means that the solvent does not have a proton on an electronegative
atom. The solvent can still have hydrogen atoms, but none of them are connected
to electronegative atoms. The most common examples of polar aprotic solvents are
acetone, DMSO, DME, and DMF:
There are, of course, other polar aprotic solvents. You should look through your
textbook and your class notes to determine if there are any other polar aprotic solvents
that you will be expected to know. If there are any more, you can add them to the
drawing above. You should learn to recognize these solvents when you see them.
So why do these solvents speed up the rate of SN2 reactions? To answer this
question, we need to talk about a solvent effect that is usually present when we
dissolve a nucleophile in a solvent. A nucleophile with a negative charge, when

9.5 FACTOR 4—THE SOLVENT 221
dissolved in a polar solvent, will get surrounded by solvent molecules in what is
called a solvent shell:
This solvent shell is in the way, holding back the nucleophile from doing what it is
supposed to do (go attack something). For the nucleophile to do its job, the nucleophile
must first shed this solvent shell. This is always the case when you dissolve a
nucleophile in a polar solvent, except when you use a polar aprotic solvent.
Polar aprotic solvents are not very good at forming solvent shells around
negative charges. So if you dissolve a nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent, the
nucleophile is said to be a “naked” nucleophile, because it does not have a solvent
shell. Therefore, it does not need to first shed a solvent shell before it can react
with something. It never had a solvent shell to begin with. This effect is drastic.
As you can imagine, a nucleophile with a solvent shell is going to spend most of
its existence with the solvent shell, and there will be only brief moments every
now and then when it is free to react. By allowing the nucleophile to react all of
the time, we are greatly speeding up the reaction. SN2 reactions performed with
nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents occur about 1000 times faster than those in
regular protic solvents.
Bottom line: Whenever a solvent is indicated, you should look to see if it is
one of the polar aprotic solvents listed above. If it is, it is a safe bet that the reaction
is going to be SN2.
EXERCISE 9.27 Predict whether the reaction below will occur via an SN2 or an
SN1 mechanism:
Answer This reaction utilizes DMSO, which is a polar aprotic solvent, so we

9.6 USING ALL FOUR FACTORS
Now that we have seen all four factors individually, we need to see how to put them
all together. When analyzing a reaction, we need to look at all four factors and make
a determination of which mechanism, SN1 or SN2, is predominating. It may not be
just one mechanism in every case. Sometimes both mechanisms occur and it is difficult
to predict which one predominates. Nevertheless, it is a lot more common to
see situations that are obviously leaning toward one mechanism over the other. For
example, it is clear that a reaction will be SN2 if we have a primary substrate with a
strong nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent. On the flipside, a reaction will clearly
be SN1 if we have a tertiary substrate with a weak nucleophile and an excellent
leaving group.
Your job is to look at all of the factors and make an informed decision. Let’s
put everything we saw into one chart. Review the chart. If there are any parts that
do not make sense, you should return to the section on that factor and review the
concepts.

2°—Both Both Good—Both

EXERCISE 9.29 For the reaction below, look at all of the reagents and conditions,
and determine if the reaction will proceed via an SN2 or an SN1, or both or neither.
Answer The substrate is primary, which immediately tells us that it needs to be
SN2. On top of that, we see that we have a strong nucleophile, which also favors SN2.
The LG is good, which doesn’t tell us much. The solvent is not indicated. So, taking
everything into account, we predict that the reaction follows an SN2 mechanism.

SN1 and SN2 reactions produce almost the same products. In both reactions, a leaving
group is replaced by a nucleophile. The difference in products between SN1 and SN2
reactions arises when the leaving group is attached to a stereocenter. In this situation,
the SN2 mechanism will invert the stereocenter, while the SN1 mechanism will produce
a racemic mixture. That’s the main difference—the configuration of one stereocenter.
It seems like a lot of work to go through to determine the configuration of one
stereocenter (which matters only some of the time).
So the obvious question is, why did we go through all of that trouble to learn

question, and it is important to spend some time on this, because it will help frame
the rest of the course for you. Let’s go through some answers one at a time.
First we learned the important concept that everything is located in the
mechanisms. By understanding the mechanisms completely, everything else can be
justified based on the mechanisms. All of the factors that influence the reaction can
be understood by carefully examining the mechanism. This is true for every reaction
you will see from now on. Now you have had some practice thinking this way.
Next we learned that there are multiple factors at play when analyzing a reaction.
Sometimes the factors can all be pointing in the same direction, while at other
times the factors can be in conflict. When they are in conflict, we need to weigh them
and decide which factors win out in determining the path of the reaction. This concept
of competing factors is a theme in organic chemistry. The experience of going
through SN1 and SN2 mechanisms has prepared you for thinking this way for all reactions
from now on.
Finally we learned that if we analyze the first factor (substrate), we will find
two effects at play: electronics and sterics. We saw that SN2 reactions require
primary or secondary substrates because of sterics—it is too crowded for the nucleophile
to attack a tertiary substrate. On the other hand, SN1 reactions did not have a
problem with sterics, but electronics was a bigger issue. Tertiary was the best,
because the alkyl groups were needed to stabilize the carbocation.
These two effects (sterics and electronics) are major themes in organic chemistry.
Much of what you learn in the rest of the course can be explained with either
an electronic or a steric argument. The sooner you learn to consider these two effects
in every problem you encounter, the better off you will be. Electronics is usually
the more complicated effect. In fact, the other three factors that we saw
(nucleophile, leaving group, and solvent effects) were all electronic arguments.
Once you get the hang of the kinds of electronic arguments that are generally made,
you will begin to see common threads in all of the reactions that you will encounter
in this course.
Don’t get me wrong—it is very important to be able to predict whether a
stereocenter gets inverted or not when a substitution reaction takes place. That alone
would have been enough of a reason to learn all of the factors in this chapter. But I
also want you to keep your eye on some of the “bigger picture” issues. They will
help you as you move through the course.
9.7 SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS TEACH US SOME IMPORTANT LESSONS 225
In the previous chapter, we saw that a substitution reaction can occur when a
compound possesses a leaving group. In this chapter, we will explore another type
of reaction, called elimination, which can also occur for compounds with leaving
groups. In fact, substitution and elimination reactions frequently compete with each
other, giving a mixture of products. At the end of this chapter, we will learn how to
predict the products of these competing reactions. For now, let’s consider the different
outcomes for substitution and elimination reactions:
In a substitution reaction, the leaving group is replaced with a nucleophile. In an
elimination reaction, a beta () proton is removed together with the leaving
group, forming a double bond. In the previous chapter, we saw two mechanisms
for substitution reactions (SN1 and SN2). In a similar way, we will now explore
two mechanisms for elimination reactions, called E1 and E2. Let’s begin with the
E2 mechanism.
10.1 THE E2 MECHANISM
In an E2 process, a base removes a proton, causing the simultaneous expulsion of a
leaving group:

ELIMINATION REACTIONS
10.2 THE REGIOCHEMICAL OUTCOME OF AN E2 REACTION 227
Notice that there is only one mechanistic step (no intermediates are formed), and that
step involves both the substrate and the base. Because that step involves two chemical
entities, it is said to be bimolecular. Bimolecular elimination reactions are called
E2 reactions, where the “2” stands for “bimolecular.”
Now let’s consider the effect of the substrate on the rate of an E2 process. Recall
from the previous chapter that SN2 reactions generally do not occur with tertiary
substrates, because of steric considerations. But E2 reactions are different than SN2
reactions, and in fact, tertiary substrates often undergo E2 reactions quite rapidly. To
explain why tertiary substrates will undergo E2 but not SN2 reactions, we must recognize
that the key difference between substitution and elimination is the role played
by the reagent. In a substitution reaction, the reagent functions as a nucleophile and
attacks an electrophilic position. In an elimination reaction, the reagent functions as a
base and removes a proton, which is easily achieved even with a tertiary substrate. In
fact, tertiary substrates react even more rapidly than primary substrates.
10.2 THE REGIOCHEMICAL OUTCOME
OF AN E2 REACTION
Recall from Chapter 8 that the term “regiochemistry” refers to where the reaction
takes place. In other words, in what region of the molecule is the reaction taking
place? When H and X are eliminated (where X is some leaving group), it is sometimes
possible for more than one alkene to form. Consider the following example, in
which two possible alkenes can be formed:
Where does the double bond form? This is a question of regiochemistry. The way we
distinguish between these two possibilities is by considering how many groups are
attached to each double bond. Double bonds can have anywhere from 1 to 4 groups
attached to them:
So, if we look back at the reaction above, we find that the two possible products are
trisubstituted and disubstituted:
Trisubstituted Disubstituted
Br EtO
+
Monosubstituted Disubstituted Trisubstituted Tetrasubstituted
Br EtO
+
For an elimination reaction where there is more than one possible alkene that
can be formed, we have names for the different products based on which alkene is
more substituted and which is less substituted. The more substituted alkene is called
the Zaitsev product, and the less substituted alkene is called the Hofmann product.
Usually, the Zaitsev product is the major product:
However, there are many exceptions in which the Zaitsev product (the moresubstituted
alkene) is not the major product. For example, if the reaction above is
performed with a sterically hindered base (rather than using ethoxide as the base),
then the major product will be the less-substituted alkene:
In this case, the Hofmann product is the major product, because a sterically hindered
base was used. This case illustrates an important concept: The regiochemical outcome
of an E2 reaction can often be controlled by carefully choosing the base. Below
are two examples of sterically hindered bases that will be encountered frequently
throughout your organic chemistry course:
PROBLEMS Draw the Zaitsev and Hofmann products that are expected when
each of the following compounds is treated with a strong base to give an E2 reaction.

10.3 THE STEREOCHEMICAL OUTCOME
OF AN E2 REACTION
The examples in the previous section focused on regiochemistry. We will now focus
our attention on stereochemistry. For example, consider performing an E2 reaction
with the following substrate:
This substrate has two identical  positions so regiochemistry is not an issue in this
case. Deprotonation of either  position produces the same result. But in this case,
stereochemistry is relevant, because two stereoisomeric alkenes are possible:
Both stereoisomers (cis and trans) are produced, but the trans product predominates.
This specific example is said to be stereoselective, because the substrate produces
two stereoisomers in unequal amounts.
In the previous example, the  position had two different protons:
In such a case, we saw that both the cis and the trans isomers were produced, with the
trans isomer being favored. Now let’s consider a case where the  position contains
only one proton. In such a case, only one product is formed. The reaction is said to be
stereospecific (rather than stereoselective), because the proton and the leaving group
must be antiperiplanar during the reaction. This is best illustrated using Newman projections,
which allow us to draw the compound in a conformation in which the proton
and the leaving group are antiperiplanar. This conformation then shows you which
stereoisomer you get. The following example will illustrate how this is done.

treated with a strong base to give an E2 reaction:
ANSWER Let’s first consider the expected regiochemical outcome of the reaction.
The reaction does not employ a sterically hindered base, so we expect formation of
the more substituted alkene (the Zaitsev product):
Now let’s consider the stereochemical outcome. In this case, the beta position (where
the reaction is taking place) has only one proton:
So, we expect this reaction to be stereospecific, rather than stereoselective. That is,
we expect only one alkene, rather than a mixture of stereoisomeric alkenes. In
order to determine which alkene is obtained, we begin by drawing the Newman
projection:
Next, we need to draw the conformation in which the H (on the front carbon) and
the leaving group (Cl) are antiperiplanar:

Newman projection shows us the stereochemical outcome (look carefully at the
dotted ovals, which are drawn to help you see the outcome more clearly):
This is the Zaitsev product that we expect. The stereoisomer of this alkene is not
produced, because the E2 process is stereospecific:
You need to get into the habit of drawing Newman projections so that you can
determine the stereoisomer that is expected from an E2 reaction. If you are rusty on
Newman Projections, you should go back and review the first two sections in
Chapter 6 in this book. Then come back to here, and try to use Newman projections
to determine the stereochemical outcome of the following reactions.

10.4 THE E1 MECHANISM
In an E1 process, there are two separate steps: the leaving group first leaves, generating
a carbocation intermediate, which then loses a proton in a separate step:
The first step (loss of the leaving group) is the rate-determining step, much like we
saw for SN1 processes. The base does not participate in this step, and therefore, the
concentration of the base does not affect the rate. Because this step involves only one
chemical entity, it is said to be unimolecular. Unimolecular elimination reactions are
called E1 reactions, where the “1” stands for “unimolecular.”
Notice that the first step of an E1 process is identical to the first step of an SN1
process. In each process, the first step involves loss of the leaving group to form a
carbocation intermediate:
An E1 reaction is generally accompanied by a competing SN1 reaction, and a mixture
of products is generally obtained. At the end of this chapter, we will explore the main
factors that affect the competition between substitution and elimination reactions.

232 CHAPTER 10 ELIMINATION REACTIONS
For now, let’s consider the effect of the substrate on the rate of an E1
process. The rate is found to be very sensitive to the nature of the starting alkyl
halide, with tertiary halides reacting more readily than secondary halides; and primary
halides generally do not undergo E1 reactions. This trend is identical to the
trend we saw for SN1 reactions, and the reason for the trend is the same as well.
Specifically, the rate-determining step of the mechanism involves formation of a
carbocation intermediate, so the rate of the reaction will be dependent on the stability
of the carbocation (recall that tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary
carbocations).
In the previous chapter, we saw that an OH group is a terrible leaving
group, and that an SN1 reaction can only occur if the OH group is first protonated to
give a better leaving group:
The same is true with an E1 process. If the substrate is an alcohol, a strong acid will
be required in order to protonate the OH group:
10.5 THE REGIOCHEMICAL OUTCOME
OF AN E1 REACTION
E1 processes show a regiochemical preference for the Zaitsev product, just as we
saw for E2 reactions. For example:
The more-substituted alkene (Zaitsev product) is the major product. However, there
is one critical difference between the regiochemical outcomes of E1 and E2 reactions.
Specifically, we have seen that the regiochemical outcome of an E2 reaction can often
be controlled by carefully choosing the base (sterically hindered or not sterically
hindered). In contrast, the regiochemical outcome of an E1 process cannot be controlled.
The Zaitsev product will generally be obtained.

10.6 THE STEREOCHEMICAL OUTCOME
OF AN E1 REACTION
E1 reactions are not stereospecific. That is, they do not require anti-periplanarity in
order for the reaction to occur. Nevertheless, E1 reactions are stereoselective. In other
words, when cis and trans products are possible, we generally observe a preference
for formation of the trans stereoisomer:
10.7 SUBSTITUTION VS. ELIMINATION
Substitution and elimination reactions are almost always in competition with each
other. In order to predict the products of a reaction, you must determine which
mechanism(s) win the competition. In some cases, there is one clear winner. For
example, consider a case in which a tertiary alkyl halide is treated with a strong
base, such as hydroxide:
Br
OH
From E2
(only product)
H2SO4
Major Minor
OH
heat +
OH
HO
OH
In a case like this, E2 wins the competition, and no other mechanisms can
successfully compete. Why not? An SN2 process cannot occur at a reasonable rate
because the substrate is tertiary (steric hindrance prevents an SN2 from occurring).
And unimolecular processes (E1 and SN1) cannot compete because they are too
slow. Recall that the rate-determining step for an E1 or SN1 process is the loss of a
leaving group to form a carbocation, which is a slow step. Therefore, E1 and SN1
could only win the competition if the competing E2 process is extremely slow (when
a weak base is used). However, when a strong base is used, E2 occurs rapidly, so E1
and SN1 cannot compete.
Now let’s consider a case where there is more than one winner, for example:
In this case, there are two winners! Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that there must
always be one clear winner. Sometimes there is, but sometimes, there are multiple
products (perhaps even more than two). The goal is to predict all of the products, and
to predict which products are major and which are minor. To accomplish this goal,
you will need to perform the following three steps:
1. Determine the function of the reagent.
2. Analyze the substrate and determine the expected mechanism(s).
3. Consider regiochemical and stereochemical requirements.
The last three sections of this chapter are devoted to helping you become competent
in performing all three steps. Let’s begin with Step 1: Determining the function of
the reagent.
10.8 DETERMINING THE FUNCTION
OF THE REAGENT
We have seen earlier in this chapter that the main difference between substitution and
elimination is the function of the reagent. A substitution reaction occurs when the
reagent functions as a nucleophile, while an elimination reaction occurs when the
reagent functions as a base. So the first step in any specific case is to determine
whether the reagent is a strong or weak nucleophile, and whether it is a strong or weak
base. Students generally assume that a strong base must also be a strong nucleophile,
but this is not always true. It is possible for a reagent to be a weak nucleophile and a
strong base. Similarly, it is possible for a reagent to be a strong nucleophile and a
weak base. In other words, basicity and nucleophilicity do not always parallel each
other. Let’s begin by seeing when they do parallel each other.
Br
MeOH
OMe
+
E1 product SN1 product
10.8 DETERMINING THE FUNCTION OF THE REAGENT 235
When comparing atoms in the same row of the periodic table, basicity and
nucleophilicity do parallel each other:
For example, let’s compare H2N and HO. The difference between these two
reagents is the identity of the atom bearing the charge (O vs. N). We already saw in
Chapter 3 (when we saw the factors determining charge stability) that oxygen, being
more electronegative than nitrogen, can stabilize a charge better than nitrogen can.
Therefore, HO will be more stable than H2N, so H2N will be a stronger base.
As it turns out, H2N will also be a stronger nucleophile than HO, because
basicity and nucleophilicity parallel each other when comparing atoms in the same
row of the periodic table.
When comparing atoms in the same column of the periodic table, basicity and
nucleophilicity do not parallel each other:
For example, let’s compare HO and HS. Once again, the difference between these
two reagents is the identity of the atom bearing the charge (O vs. S). We already saw
in Chapter 3 that sulfur, being larger than oxygen, can stabilize a charge better than
oxygen can (remember we saw that size is more important than electronegativity
when comparing atoms in the same column). Therefore, HS will be more stable
than HO, so HO will be a stronger base. Nevertheless, HS is a better nucleophile
than HO. Why?
Recall that basicity and nucleophilicity are different concepts. Basicity measures
stability of the charge (a thermodynamic argument), whereas nucleophilicity measures
how fast a nucleophile attacks something (a kinetic argument). When you have a large
atom, like sulfur, an interesting effect comes into play. As the sulfur atom approaches
an electrophile (a compound with ), the electron density within the sulfur atom gets
polarized, meaning that the electron density can move around. This effect increases
the force of attraction between the nucleophile and the electrophile, so the rate of

attack is very fast. Since nucleophilicity is a measure of how fast the nucleophile attacks,
this effect renders the sulfur atom very nucleophilic. As a result, HS functions
almost exclusively as a nucleophile and rarely functions as a base. The same is true for
most of the halides (especially iodide), which function exclusively as nucleophiles.
The halides are generally too weakly basic to function as bases. So, when you see one
of these nucleophiles, you do not need to worry about elimination reactions – you will
only get substitution reactions. It is very common to see the halides being used as
nucleophiles, so it is very helpful to know that you do not need to worry about elimination
reactions when you see a halide as the reagent.
Armed with the understanding that nucleophilicity and basicity are not the
same concepts, we can now categorize reagents into the following four groups:
Let’s quickly review each of these four categories. The first category contains
reagents that function only as nucleophiles. They are strong nucleophiles because
they are highly polarizable, but they are weak bases. When you see a reagent from
this category, you should focus exclusively on substitution reactions (not
elimination). Notice that sulfuric acid is NOT in this category (or any of the categories
above). It is true that sulfuric acid contains sulfur, but the sulfur atom in
sulfuric acid does not possess a lone pair, so it cannot function as a nucleophile. As
its name implies, sulfuric acid functions only as an acid, so it is not listed in any of
the four categories above.
The second category contains reagents that function only as bases; not as nucleophiles.
The first reagent on this list is the hydride ion, usually shown as NaH, where
Na is the counter ion. The hydride ion of NaH is not a good nucleophile, despite the
presence of a negative charge, because hydrogen is very small so it is not sufficiently
polarizable. Nevertheless, the hydride ion is a very strong base. The use of a hydride
ion as the reagent indicates that elimination will occur rather than substitution.
Notice that tert-butoxide appears in both the second and third categories.
Technically, it is a strong nucleophile and a strong base, so it belongs in the third
category. But practically, tert-butoxide is sterically hindered, which prevents it from
functioning as a nucleophile in most cases. Therefore, it is often used as a base, to
favor E2 over SN2.
The third category contains reagents that are both strong nucleophiles and
strong bases. These reagents include hydroxide (HO) and alkoxide ions (RO), and
are generally used for bimolecular processes (SN2 and E2).

10.8 DETERMINING THE FUNCTION OF THE REAGENT 237
The fourth and final category contains reagents that are weak nucleophiles and
weak bases. These reagents include water (H2O) and alcohols (ROH), and are generally
used for unimolecular processes (SN1 and E1).
In order to predict the products of a reaction, the first step is determining the
identity and nature of the reagent. That is, you must analyze the reagent and determine
the category to which it belongs. Let’s get some practice with this critical skill.
PROBLEMS Identify the function of each of the following reagents. In each case,
the reagent will fall into one of the following four categories:
(a) strong nucleophile and weak base
(b) weak nucleophile and strong base
(c) strong nucleophile and strong base
(d) weak nucleophile and weak base

10.9 IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISM(S)
We mentioned that there are three main steps for predicting the products of substitution
and elimination reactions. In the previous section, we explored the first step (determining
the function of the reagent). In this section, we now explore the second step of the
process in which we analyze the substrate and identify which mechanism(s) operates.
As described in the previous section, there are four categories of reagents. For
each category, we must explore the expected outcome with a primary, secondary, or
tertiary substrate. All of the relevant information is summarized in the following
flow chart. It is important to know this flow chart extremely well, but be careful not
to memorize it. It is more important to “understand” the reasons for all of these
outcomes. A proper understanding will prove to be far more useful on an exam than
simply memorizing a set of rules.

Reagent Substrate Mechanism Explanation
Not practical, because the reactions are too slow
When the reagent functions exclusively as a
nucleophile (and not as a base), only substitution
reactions occur (not elimination). The substrate
determines which mechanism operates. SN2
predominates for primary substrates, and SN1
predominates for tertiary substrates. For secondary
substrates, both SN2 and SN1 can occur, although
SN2 is generally favored (especially when a polar
aprotic solvent is used).
Under these conditions, unimolecular reactions (SN1
and E1) are favored. High temperature favors E1. A
tertiary alcohol will undergo an E1 reaction when treated
with sulfuric acid and heat.

10.9 IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISM(S) 239
ANSWER Our first step is to identify the function of the reagent. Using the skills
developed in the previous section, we know that sodium hydroxide is both a strong
nucleophile and a strong base:
Our next step is to identify the substrate. In this case, the substrate is 3-bromopentane,
which is a secondary substrate, and therefore, we expect E2 and SN2 mechanisms
to operate:
The E2 pathway is expected to provide the major product, because the SN2 pathway
is more sensitive to steric hindrance provided by secondary substrates.
PROBLEMS Identify the mechanism(s) expected to occur in each of the following
cases. Do not worry about drawing the products yet. We will do that in the next
section. For now, just identify which mechanisms are operating:

10.10 PREDICTING THE PRODUCTS
We mentioned that predicting the products of substitution and elimination reactions
requires three discrete steps:
1. Determine the function of the reagent.
2. Analyze the substrate and determine the expected mechanism(s).
3. Consider any relevant regiochemical and stereochemical requirements.
In the previous two sections, we explored the first two steps of this process. In this section,
we will explore the third and final step. After determining which mechanism(s)
are expected to operate, the final step is to consider the regiochemical and stereochemical
outcomes for each of the expected mechanisms. The following table provides
a summary of guidelines that must be followed when drawing products.
10.10 PREDICTING THE PRODUCTS 241
Regiochemical Outcome Stereochemical Outcome
SN2
The nucleophile attacks the
 position, where the leaving
group is connected.
The nucleophile replaces the
leaving group with inversion
of configuration.
SN1
The nucleophile attacks the
carbocation, which is generally
where the leaving group
was originally connected, unless
a carbocation rearrangement
took place.
The nucleophile replaces
the leaving group with
racemization.
E2
The Zaitsev product is generally
favored over the
Hofmann product, unless a
sterically hindered base is
used, in which case the
Hofmann product will be
favored.
This process is both stereoselective
and stereospecific.
When applicable, a trans disubstituted
alkene will be
favored over a cis disubstituted
alkene.
When the  position of the
substrate has only one proton,
the stereoisomeric alkene
resulting from antiperiplanar
elimination will be obtained
(exclusively, in most cases).
E1
The Zaitsev product is always
favored over the Hofmann
product.
The process is stereoselective.
When applicable, a
trans disubstituted alkene
will be favored over a cis disubstituted
alkene.
The table above does not contain any new information. All of the information
can be found in this chapter and in the previous chapter. The table is meant only as
a summary of all of the relevant information, so that it is easily accessible in one
location. Let’s get some practice applying these guidelines.
EXERCISE 10.26 Predict the product(s) of the following reaction, and identify
the major and minor products:
Answer In order to draw the products, we must follow these three steps:
1. Determine the function of the reagent.
2. Analyze the substrate and determine the expected mechanism(s).
3. Consider any relevant regiochemical and stereochemical requirements.
We begin by analyzing the reagent. The methoxide ion is both a strong base and a
strong nucleophile. Next, we move on to Step 2 and we analyze the substrate. In this
case, the substrate is secondary, so we would expect E2 and SN2 pathways to compete
with each other:
We expect the E2 pathway to predominate, because it is less sensitive to steric hindrance
than the SN2 pathway. Therefore, we would expect the major product(s) to be
generated via an E2 process, and the minor product(s) to be generated via an SN2
process. In order to draw the products, we must complete the third and final step.
That is, we must consider the regiochemical and stereochemical outcomes for both
the E2 and SN2 processes. Let’s begin with the E2 process.
For the regiochemical outcome, we expect the Zaitsev product to be the major
product, because the reaction does not utilize a sterically hindered base:

Next, look at the stereochemistry. The E2 process is stereoselective, so we expect
cis and trans isomers, with a predominance of the trans isomer:
The E2 process is not only stereoselective, but it is also stereospecific. However, in
this case, the  position has more than one proton, so the stereospecificity of this reaction
is not relevant.
Now consider the SN2 product. This case involves a stereocenter, so we expect
inversion of configuration:
In summary, we expect the following products:

ADDITION REACTIONS
Addition reactions are characterized by two groups adding across a double bond:
In the process, the double bond is destroyed, and we say that the two groups (X and
Y) have “added” across the double bond. In this chapter, we will see many addition
reactions, and we will focus on the following three types of problems: (1) predicting
the products of a reaction, (2) proposing a mechanism, and (3) proposing a synthesis.
In order to gain mastery over these types of problems, you must first become
comfortable with some crucial terminology. We will focus on this terminology now,
before learning any reactions.
11.1 TERMINOLOGY DESCRIBING
REGIOCHEMISTRY
When adding two different groups across an unsymmetrical alkene, there is special
terminology describing the regiochemistry of the addition. For example, suppose
you are adding H and Br across an alkene. Regiochemistry refers to the positioning
of the H and the Br in the product: which side gets the H and which side gets the Br?
Regiochemistry is only relevant when adding two different groups (such as H and
Br). However, when adding two of the same group (such as Br and Br), regiochemistry
becomes irrelevant:
Similarly, when adding two different groups across a symmetrical alkene, regiochemistry
is also irrelevant:
H Br
Symmetrical
is the same as Br H
Br
Br
Addition of ?
H and Br
?
X Y
Addition of
X and Y
245
The bottom line is: regiochemistry is only relevant when adding two different groups
across an unsymmetrical alkene.
As we learn addition reactions, we will be using two important terms to describe
the regiochemistry: Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov. To use these terms
properly, we must be able to recognize which carbon is more substituted. Consider
the following example:
There are two vinylic positions, highlighted in grey above. The vinylic position on
the right has more alkyl groups; it is more substituted. When Br ends up on the more
substituted carbon, we call it a Markovnikov addition:
When Br ends up on the less substituted carbon, we call it an anti-Markovnikov
addition:
When we explore the mechanisms of addition reactions, we will see why some reactions
proceed through a Markovnikov addition while others proceed through an
anti-Markovnikov addition. For now, let’s make sure that we are comfortable using
the terms.
EXERCISE 11.1 Draw the product that you would expect from an anti-
Markovnikov addition of H and Br across the following alkene:
Answer In an anti-Markovnikov addition, the Br (the group other than H) ends up
at the less substituted carbon, so we draw the following product:

added.

STEREOCHEMISTRY
In addition to the regiochemistry, there is also special terminology used to describe
the stereochemistry of a reaction. As an example, consider the following simple
alkene:
Suppose that we have an anti-Markovnikov addition of H and OH across this alkene:
We know which two groups are adding to the double bond, and we know the regiochemistry
of the addition. But in order to draw the products correctly, we also need
to know the stereochemistry of the reaction. To better explain this, we will redraw
the alkene in a different way.
The vinylic carbon atoms, highlighted above, are both sp2 hybridized, and therefore
trigonal planar. As a result, all four groups (connected to the vinylic positions) are

in one plane. In order to discuss stereochemistry, we will rotate the molecule so that
the plane is coming in and out of the page:
This is an unusual way to draw an alkene (where all bonds are shown as wedges and
dashes, rather than straight lines), but this way of drawing the alkene will make it
easier to explore stereochemistry.
We can imagine both groups being added on the same side of the plane (either
from above the plane or from below the plane), which we call a syn addition:
Or, we can imagine both groups being added on opposite sides of the plane, which
we call an anti addition:
Note: Do not confuse the term “anti” with the term “anti-Markovnikov.” The
term “anti” describes the stereochemistry, while the term “anti-Markovnikov” describes
the regiochemistry. It is possible for an anti-Markovnikov reaction to be a syn
addition. In fact, we will see such an example very soon.
We see that there are two products that arise from a syn addition, and two
products that arise from an anti addition:
In total, there are four possible products (two pairs of enantiomers). The two
products of a syn addition represent one pair of enantiomers. And the two products
from an anti addition represent the other pair of enantiomers.

Some reactions are not stereospecific, and we might expect all four possible
products (both pairs of enantiomers). Other reactions are stereospecific—we might
predominantly get the two enantiomers from a syn addition, or we might predominantly
get the two enantiomers from an anti addition. It is important to know which
reactions occur through an anti addition, which reactions occur through a syn addition,
and which reactions are not stereospecific at all. As we go through each reaction
in this chapter, we will look closely at the mechanism for each reaction, because
the mechanism will always explain the stereochemistry of the reaction. For now, let’s
make sure that we know the terminology. We will practice drawing the products
when all of the information has been provided (which two groups to add, the
regiochemistry, and the stereochemistry).

way:
Regiochemistry  anti-Markovnikov
Stereochemistry  syn addition
Answer We begin by looking at the regiochemistry. The reaction is anti-
Markovnikov, which means that the OH group will be positioned at the less substituted
carbon:
Next, we look at the stereochemistry. The reaction is a syn addition, which means
that the H and OH both add on the same side of the double bond. In order to see
this more clearly, we rotate the molecule so that the plane of the double bond is
coming out of the page, and we draw the pair of enantiomers that we expect from
a syn addition:

However, you may encounter examples where no stereocenters are being formed.
For example,
In situations like this, the stereochemistry is irrelevant. You will only get one product
(no stereoisomers).
Similarly, you may encounter situations where only one stereocenter is being
formed. For example,
In cases like this, the stereochemistry is still irrelevant (as long as the compound
does not possess any other stereocenters). Why? With only one stereocenter, there
will only be two possible products (not four). These two products will represent a
pair of enantiomers (one will be R and the other will be S). You will get both of these
products whether the reaction proceeds through a syn addition or through an anti
addition. If the reaction is a syn addition, the OH group can come from above the
plane or from below the plane of the double bond, giving both possible products.
Similarly, if the reaction is an anti addition, the OH group can come from above the
plane or from below the plane of the double bond, giving both possible products.
Either way, we get the two possible products.
The bottom line is: the stereochemistry is only relevant when the addition reaction
involves the creation of two new stereocenters.
EXERCISE 11.16 Given the following information, determine if the stereochemistry
of the reaction is relevant, and draw the expected products:
Answer We begin by looking at the regiochemistry. We are not told what the regiochemistry
is, because it is irrelevant (we are adding two groups of the same kind:
OH and OH). Next, we look at the stereochemistry. The reaction is a syn addition.

Therefore, the fact that the reaction proceeds through a syn addition is not important
for predicting the products. If the reaction had been an anti addition, we would have
obtained the same products. In fact, if the reaction had not been stereospecific at all,
we still would have obtained the same two products (the pair of enantiomers above).

Consider the following example:
An analysis of the information given should lead us to draw the following
products:
However, there are not two products here. Look closely and you will see that the two
drawings above are actually the same compound. This compound is a meso compound,
because it has an internal plane of symmetry. In a case like this, there is actually
only one product. You can either draw the product with both OH groups on
wedges, or you can draw it with both OH groups on dashes. Either way, you are

drawing the same product. Just make sure not to draw both drawings, because that
would imply that you don’t recognize that it is a meso compound.
Here is another case where it is not so simple to see:
An analysis of the information should lead us to predict the following products:
At first glance, it might be difficult to see that these two compounds are the same
(they represent two drawings of the same meso compound). But if you rotate about
the CˆC single bond, you can see that it actually does have a plane of symmetry:
This is a subtle but important point. If you are not comfortable with identifying meso
compounds, you should go back and review meso compounds in Chapter 7.
EXERCISE 11.21 Given the following information, draw the expected products:
Answer We begin by looking at the regiochemistry. In this case, we are adding
two groups of the same kind (OH and OH), so the regiochemistry is irrelevant.
Next, we look at the stereochemistry. We are creating two new stereocenters
in this case, which means that we could potentially create four products here, but we
won’t get all four. The reaction is a syn addition, so we will only get the pair of enantiomers
that would come from a syn addition. To draw this pair of enantiomers, we
do not have to rotate the alkene, as we have done in previous examples. In this
example, it is simple enough to draw the products without rotating the alkene (sometimes,
it will be simpler to do it this way):

But wait! As a final step, we must determine whether the products are actually a pair

We look for a plane of symmetry, and in this case, we do have a plane of symmetry.
Therefore, we don’t draw both drawings above as our answer. We choose one
drawing (either one). So our answer would look like this:

provided. (Some products might be meso compounds, and others might not—be

Until now, we have learned the basic terminology that you will need in order
to predict products of addition reactions. To summarize, there are three pieces of information
that you must have in order to predict products:
1. Which two groups are being added across the double bond (X and Y)?
2. What is the regiochemistry? (Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov)
3. What is the stereochemistry? (syn or anti)
With these three pieces of information, you should be able to predict products with
ease. Until now, you have been given all three pieces of information in each
problem. However, as we progress through this chapter, this information will not

be given to you. Rather, you will have to look at the reagents being used, and you
will have to determine all three pieces of information on your own. That might
sound like it involves a lot of memorization. Not so. We will soon see that the mechanism
of each reaction contains all three pieces of information that you need. By
understanding the mechanism for each reaction, you will “know” all three pieces
of information about each reaction. We will focus on understanding, rather than
memorization.
11.3 ADDING H AND H
It is possible to add H and H across an alkene. Here are two examples:
In this type of reaction, called hydrogenation, the regiochemistry will always be irrelevant,
regardless of what alkene we use (we are adding two of the same group).
However, we do need to explore the stereochemistry of hydrogenation reactions. In
order to do this, let’s take a close look at how the reaction takes place.
Notice the reagents that we use to accomplish a hydrogenation reaction (H2
and a metal catalyst). A variety of metal catalysts can be used, such as Pt, Pd, or Ni.
The hydrogen molecules (H2) interact with the surface of the metal catalyst, effectively
breaking the HˆH bonds:
This forms individual hydrogen atoms adsorbed to the surface of the metal. These
hydrogen atoms are now available for addition across the alkene. The addition reaction
begins when the alkene coordinates with the metal surface:

Surface chemistry then allows for the following two steps, effectively adding H and
H across the alkene:
Notice that the alkene grabs both hydrogen atoms on the same side of the alkene.
Therefore, we get a syn addition.
The requirement for syn addition can be seen in the following example:
The hydrogen atoms that were added are not explicitly shown, but remember that
H’s don’t need to be drawn in bond-line drawings. You should be able to see them,
even though they are not drawn.
In the example above, we are creating two new stereocenters. So, theoretically,
we could imagine four possible products (two pairs of enantiomers):
But we don’t get all four products. We only get the pair of enantiomers that come
from a syn addition (above left):
But be careful—make sure to be on the lookout for meso compounds. Consider this
example:

(a) (b)
Answer (a) Just as we can hydrogenate an alkene, we can also deuterate an alkene
(deuterium is just an isotope of hydrogen). Therefore, we will be adding D and D
across the alkene. We do not need to worry about regiochemistry, because we are
adding two of the same group. However stereochemistry is relevant here, because we
are creating two new stereocenters. Of the four possible products, we will only get
the pair of enantiomers that would come from a syn addition:
(b) These reagents will add H and H across a double bond. We do not need to worry
about regiochemistry, because we are adding two of the same group. To determine
whether stereochemistry is relevant, we must ask whether we are creating two new
stereocenters. In this example, we are not creating two new stereocenters. In fact, we
are not even creating one stereocenter. Therefore, stereochemistry is irrelevant in this
example. There will only be one product here:

We will now explore the details of adding a hydrogen halide (HX) across a double
bond. Here are two examples:

must analyze the proposed mechanism. When adding HX across a double bond,

260 CHAPTER 11 ADDITION REACTIONS
Step 1: Proton Transfer:
In this step, a proton is transferred to the alkene, which generates a carbocation.
This carbocation is then attacked by the halide in step 2:
Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack:
The overall result is the addition of H and X across the double bond. We
have specifically used a starting alkene that avoids issues of regiochemistry
or stereochemistry; we will soon see other examples in which we must explore
both of those issues. For now, focus on the curved arrows used in
both steps. It is absolutely critical to master the art of drawing curved arrows
properly. Let’s quickly practice:
EXERCISE 11.33 Draw a mechanism for the following reaction:
Answer In the first step, there are two curved arrows:
One curved arrow is drawn coming from the alkene and pointing to the proton (take
special notice of this arrow, as it is a very common mistake to draw this arrow in the
wrong direction). The second curved arrow is drawn coming from the HˆCl bond
and pointing to Cl.
In the second step, there is just one curved arrow. The chloride ion, formed in
the previous step, now attacks the carbocation:

All of the examples above were symmetrical alkenes, so regiochemistry was
not relevant. Now let’s consider a case where regiochemistry is relevant. With an unsymmetrical
alkene, we must decide where to put the H and where to put the X. For
example,
In other words, we must determine whether the reaction is a Markovnikov addition
or an anti-Markovnikov addition. As promised, the answer to this question is contained
in the mechanism. In the first step of the mechanism, a proton was transferred
to the alkene, to form a carbocation. When starting with an unsymmetrical alkene,
we are confronted with two possible carbocations that can form (depending on
where we place the proton):
Do we transfer the proton to the more substituted carbon:

262 CHAPTER 11 ADDITION REACTIONS
Or do we transfer the proton to the less substituted carbon:
To answer this question, we compare the carbocations that would be formed in each
scenario:
Recall that tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary carbocations.
When given the choice, we expect the alkene to accept the proton in such a way as
to form the more stable carbocation intermediate. In order to accomplish this, the
proton must add to the less substituted carbon, generating the more substituted
carbocation:
The last step of the mechanism involves the halide attacking the carbocation. As a
result, the halide will end up on the more substituted carbon (where the carbocation
was). Therefore, this reaction is said to follow Markovnikov’s rule:
As we saw in the previous section, Markovnikov’s rule tells us to place the H on
the less substituted carbon, and to place the X on the more substituted carbon. The
rule is named after Vladimir Markovnikov, a Russian chemist, who first showed
the regiochemical preference of HBr additions to alkenes. When Markovnikov recognized
this pattern in the late 19th century, he stated the rule in terms of the
placement of the proton (specifically, that the proton will end up on the less substituted
carbon atom). Now that we understand the reason for the regiochemical
preference (carbocation stability), we can state Markovnikov’s rule in a way that
more accurately reflects the underlying principle: The regiochemistry will be
determined by the preference for the reaction to proceed via the more stable
carbocation intermediate.

Notice that the regiochemistry of this reaction is explained by the mechanism.
Don’t try to memorize that the regiochemistry of this reaction is Markovnikov.
Rather, try to “understand why” it must be that way.
In any reaction, the mechanism should explain not only the regiochemistry, but
the stereochemistry as well. In this particular reaction (addition of HˆX across
alkenes), the stereochemistry is generally not relevant. Recall from the previous section
that we need to consider stereochemistry (syn vs. anti) only in cases where the
reaction generates two new stereocenters. If only one stereocenter is formed, then we
expect a pair of enantiomers (racemic mixture), regardless of whether the reaction
was anti or syn. You will probably not see an example where two new stereocenters
are formed, because the stereochemical outcome in such a case is complex and is beyond
the scope of our conversation.
The details of this reaction can now be summarized with the following chart:

EXERCISE 11.38 Predict the product of the following reaction:
Answer We begin by focusing on the regiochemistry. This alkene is unsymmetrical,
so we must decide where to place the H and where to place the Cl. To do this,
we must identify which carbon is more substituted:
This reaction proceeds according to Markovnikov’s rule, which tells us to place the
H on the less substituted carbon, and to place the Cl on the more substituted carbon:

264 CHAPTER 11 ADDITION REACTIONS
We do not need to think about stereochemistry here, because the product does not
contain two stereocenters (in fact, it doesn’t even have one stereocenter). Therefore,
stereochemistry is irrelevant in this example. As we have said, the stereochemistry
of this reaction (HˆX addition) will generally not be relevant in the problems that
you will encounter.
PROBLEMS Predict the products for each of the following reactions. After finishing
each problem, also try to draw the mechanism so that you can “see” exactly
why the reaction proceeds through Markovnikov’s rule.

11.41
11.42
In order to understand the regiochemistry of HX additions to alkenes, we focused
our attention on the intermediate carbocation. We argued that the reaction
would proceed via the more stable carbocation. This all-important principle will also
help explain why some reactions will involve a rearrangement. For example, consider
the following reaction:
At first glance, the product is not what we might have expected. Once again, we turn
to the mechanism for an explanation. The first step of the mechanism is identical to
what we have seen so far—we protonate the double bond to produce the more stable
carbocation (secondary, rather than primary):
H
Cl
+ Cl
H Cl Cl
H I
H Br

Now the carbocation is ready to be attacked by chloride. However, there is something
else that can happen first (before chloride has a chance to attack): A hydride
shift can produce a more stable carbocation:
This tertiary carbocation can now be attacked by chloride to give the product:
Clearly, we must be able to predict when to expect a carbocation rearrangement.
There are two common ways for a carbocation to rearrange: either through a hydride
shift or through a methyl shift. Your textbook will have examples of each. Carbocation
rearrangements are possible for any reaction that involves an intermediate carbocation
(not just for addition of HX across an alkene). Later in this chapter, we will
see other addition reactions that also proceed through carbocation intermediates. In
those cases, you will be expected to know that there will be a possibility for carbocation
rearrangements.
Let’s get some practice.
EXERCISE 11.43 Draw a mechanism for the following reaction:
Answer In the first step, we protonate the alkene:
There were two ways that we could have protonated, and we chose the way that
would produce the secondary carbocation (rather than producing a primary carbocation).

In the previous section, we saw how to add H and X, placing X at the more substituted
carbon (Markovnikov addition). There is another reaction that will allow us to
add H and X anti-Markovnikov, but it only works well with HBr (not any other
H—X).

If we use HBr in the presence of peroxides (ROOR), Br ends up on the less
substituted carbon:
Why does the presence of peroxides cause the addition to be anti-Markovnikov? In
order to understand the answer to this question, we will need to explore the mechanism
in detail. This reaction follows a mechanism that involves radical intermediates
(such as Br•), rather than ionic intermediates (such as Br). Peroxides are used to
generate bromine radicals, in the following way:
The OˆO bond of the peroxide is easily broken in the presence of light (hv)
or heat. When this happens, the bond is broken homolytically, which means that two
radicals are formed:
Each of these RO radicals can then abstract a hydrogen atom from HBr, to form the
reactive intermediate (Br•):
In your mind, you can compare the step above to a proton transfer. But there is one
important difference. In a proton transfer, we are transferring H (a proton is the nucleus
of a hydrogen atom, without its corresponding electron) from one place to another,
via an ionic process. But here, we are transferring an H• (an entire hydrogen
atom: proton and electron), and therefore, we are dealing with a radical process.
Now that Br• has formed, it can attack the alkene, like this:
Notice that we have been using one-headed curved arrows exclusively:
These arrows (called fishhook arrows) are the hallmark of radical reactions. We use
fishhook arrows in radical mechanisms, because they indicate the movement of only
one electron, rather than two electrons (by contrast, two-headed curved arrows are
used in ionic mechanisms to show the movement of two electrons).
In the step above, Br• attacked the alkene at the less substituted carbon, in
order to form the more substituted carbon radical (C•). Tertiary radicals are more stable
than secondary radicals, for the same reason that tertiary carbocations are more
stable than secondary carbocations. Just as alkyl groups donate electron density to
rather than

268 CHAPTER 11 ADDITION REACTIONS
stabilize a neighboring, empty p-orbital, so too, alkyl groups can stabilize a neighboring,
partially filled orbital. This preference for forming a tertiary radical (rather
than a secondary radical) dictates that Br• will attack the less substituted carbon. This
explains the observed anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry.
As a final step, the carbon radical then abstracts a hydrogen atom from HBr to
give the product:
As a side product of this reaction, we regenerate another Br•, which can go and react
with another alkene. We call this a chain reaction, and the reaction occurs very rapidly.
In fact, when peroxides are present (to jump-start this chain process), the reaction
occurs much more rapidly than the competing ionic addition of HBr that we saw
in the previous section.
Compare the intermediate of this radical mechanism with the intermediate of
an ionic mechanism:
In both mechanisms, the regiochemistry is determined by a preference for forming
the most stable intermediate possible. For example, in the ionic mechanism, H adds
to produce a tertiary carbocation, rather than a secondary carbocation. Similarly, in
the radical mechanism, Br• adds to produce a tertiary radical, rather than a secondary
radical. In this respect, the two reactions are very similar. But take special notice
of the fundamental difference. In the ionic mechanism, the proton comes on first.
However, in the radical mechanism, the bromine comes on first. This critical difference
explains why an ionic mechanism gives a Markovnikov addition while a radical
mechanism gives an anti-Markovnikov addition.

Until now we have focused on the regiochemistry of this reaction. We did not
explore the stereochemistry, because it is beyond the scope of the course. In situations
where two stereocenters are formed, the results are dependent on the starting
alkene and on the temperature. Therefore, we will only present problems where no
stereocenters are formed, or where only one stereocenter is formed.
EXERCISE 11.48 Predict the product for the following reaction:
Answer HBr indicates that we will be adding H and Br across the double
bond. The presence of peroxides indicates that the regiochemistry will be anti-
Markovnikov. To determine whether stereochemistry is relevant in this particular
case, we need to look at whether we are creating two new stereocenters. When we
place the Br on the less substituted carbon (and the H on the more substituted carbon),
we will only be creating one new stereocenter. With only one stereocenter,
there are not four possible stereoisomers but just two possible products (a pair of
enantiomers). And we will get this pair of enantiomers regardless of whether the reaction
was syn or anti:

We have now seen two pathways for adding HBr across a double bond: the
ionic pathway (which gives Markovnikov addition) and the radical pathway (which
gives anti-Markovnikov addition). Both pathways are actually in competition with
each other. However, the radical reaction is a much faster reaction. Therefore, we can
control the regiochemistry of addition by carefully choosing the conditions. If we use
a radical initiator, like ROOR, then the radical pathway will predominate, and we
will see an anti-Markovnikov addition. If we do not use a radical initiator, then the
ionic pathway will predominate, and we will see a Markovnikov addition:
Let’s get a bit of practice with choosing the appropriate conditions for addition
of HBr.
EXERCISE 11.53 In the following hydrobromination reaction, determine whether
or not you should use peroxides:
Answer In order to determine whether or not to use peroxides, we must decide
whether the desired transformation represents a Markovnikov addition or an anti-
Markovnikov addition. When we compare the starting alkene above with the desired
product, we see that we need to place the Br at the more substituted carbon (i.e.,
Markovnikov addition). Therefore, we need an ionic pathway to predominate, and
we should not use peroxides. We just use HBr:

11.6 ADDING H AND OH, MARKOVNIKOV
Over the next two sections, we will learn how to add H and OH across a double
bond. The process of adding water across an alkene is called hydration, and it can
be achieved through a Markovnikov addition or through an anti-Markovnikov addition.
We just need to carefully choose our reagents. In this section, we will explore
the reagents that give a Markovnikov addition of water. Then, in the next section, we
will explore reagents that give an anti-Markovnikov addition of water.
Consider the following reaction:
Careful comparison of the starting material and product will reveal that we have performed
a hydration, with Markovnikov regiochemistry. Notice the reagent that we
used (H3O). Essentially, this is water (H2O) and an acid source (such as sulfuric
acid). There are many ways to show this reagent. Sometimes, it is written as H3O
(as above), while at other times, it might be written like this: H2O , H. You might
even see it like this, with brackets around the acid:
These brackets indicate that H is not consumed in the reaction. In other words, H
is a catalyst, and therefore, we call this reaction an acid-catalyzed hydration. In order
to understand why this reaction proceeds via a Markovnikov addition, we turn our
attention to the mechanism. The proposed mechanism of an acid-catalyzed hydration

is similar to the mechanism of addition of HX (the ionic pathway). Compare these
two mechanisms:
In each mechanism above, the first step involves protonation of the alkene to form a
carbocation. Then, in both cases, a nucleophile (either X or H2O) attacks the carbocation
to give a product. The difference between these two reactions is in the nature
of the product. The first reaction above (hydrohalogenation) gives a product that
is neutral (no charge). However, the second reaction above (hydration) produced a
charged species. Therefore, one more step is necessary at the end of the hydration
reaction—we must get rid of the positive charge. To do this, we simply deprotonate:
Notice what reagent we use to pull off the proton. We use H2O, rather than using
a hydroxide ion (HO). To understand why, remember that we are in acidic conditions;
there really aren’t many hydroxide ions floating around. But there is plenty of water,
and a mechanism must always be consistent with the conditions that are present.
Now that we have seen all of the individual steps, let’s look at the entire
mechanism:
Notice that we are using equilibrium arrows here ( rather than ). These
equilibrium arrows indicate that the reaction actually goes in both directions. In
fact, the reverse path (starting from the alcohol and ending with the alkene) is a reaction
that we have already studied. It is just an E1 reaction (follow the sequence
above from the end to the beginning, and convince yourself that it is the E1 process).
The truth is that most reactions represent equilibrium processes, however, organic
chemists (generally) only make an effort to draw equilibrium arrows in situations
where the equilibrium can be easily manipulated (allowing us to control which

products we get). This reaction is one of those situations. By carefully controlling
the amount of water present (using either concentrated acid or dilute acid), we can
favor one side of the equilibrium or the other:
We are exploiting Le Chatelier’s principle, which tells us that the equilibrium can
be pushed toward one side or the other by removing or adding reagents. Imagine that
you have the system shown above (alkene  water on the left side; alcohol on the right
side), and this system has reached equilibrium. Then you add water. The concentrations
would no longer be at equilibrium, and the system would have to adjust to re-establish
new equilibrium concentrations. The end result: adding water would cause more alkene
to turn into alcohol. Therefore, we would use dilute acid (which is mostly water) to
favor the alcohol. If we wanted to favor the alkene, then we would want to remove
water, which would push the equilibrium toward the left. Therefore, if we want to form
the alkene, we would use concentrated acid (which is mostly acid and very little water).
Once again, we see that carefully choosing reaction conditions can greatly affect
the outcome of a reaction.
We have already explained the regiochemistry of acid-catalyzed hydration;
there is a strong preference for Markovnikov addition. But what about the
stereochemistry?
The stereochemistry of acid-catalyzed hydration is very similar to the stereochemistry
of ionic addition of HX (this should make sense, as we have already seen
that the mechanisms for each of these reactions are identical). If only one stereocenter
is formed, then we expect a pair of enantiomers (racemic mixture), regardless of
whether the reaction was anti or syn. You will probably not see an example where two
new stereocenters are formed, because the stereochemical outcome in such a case is
complex and is beyond the scope of our conversation.

11.7 ADDING H AND OH,
ANTI-MARKOVNIKOV
In the previous section, we saw how to perform a Markovnikov addition of H and
OH across a double bond. In this section, we will learn how to perform an anti-
Markovnikov addition of H and OH, for example:
A quick glance at the products indicates that we are adding H and OH across
the alkene. Let’s take a closer look and carefully analyze the regiochemistry and
stereochemistry of this reaction. The OH is ending up on the less substituted carbon,
and therefore, the regiochemistry represents an anti-Markovnikov addition. But what
about the stereochemistry? Are we seeing a syn addition here, or is this anti addition?
Be careful. The example above represents somewhat of an optical illusion. The
products seem to suggest an anti addition (the methyl and the OH are trans to each
other). But think about what we added in this reaction: we did not add OH and a
methyl group. The methyl group was already there. Rather, we added OH and H. The
H that we added is not shown in the product above (because it does not have to be
drawn in a bond-line drawing). If you draw that H on the compound above, you will
see that it is on a dash—therefore, this was a syn addition of H and OH.
To recap, the reaction above is an addition of H and OH, with anti-Markovnikov
regiochemistry, and syn stereochemistry. Now we have three important questions to
answer:
1. How do these reagents (BH3, etc.) cause an addition of H and OH?
2. Why anti-Markovnikov?
3. Why syn?
The answers to all three of these questions are encapsulated in the mechanism as
usual. In order to explore the accepted mechanism, we must first acquaint ourselves
with the reagents. In the first step, the reagents are BH3 and THF. The former is
called borane. The element boron uses its three valence electrons to comfortably
form three bonds:
However, in this structure, boron does not have an octet. It has an empty p orbital, (very
similar to a carbocation, except there is no positive charge here). Therefore, borane is
very reactive. In fact, it reacts with itself to give dimeric structures, called diborane:

2) H2O2 , NaOH

276 CHAPTER 11 ADDITION REACTIONS
The empty p orbital in borane can be somewhat stabilized if we use a solvent
(like THF) that can donate electron density into the empty p orbital of boron:
This solvent is called tetrahydrofuran, or THF for short. Even though it somewhat
stabilizes the empty p orbital on the boron atom in BH3, nevertheless the boron atom
is very eager to look for any other sources of electron density that it can find. It is an
electrophile—it is scavenging for sites of high electron density to fill its empty orbital.
A pi bond is a site of high electron density, and therefore, a pi bond can attack
borane. In fact, this is the first step of our mechanism. A pi bond attacks the empty
p orbital of boron, which triggers a simultaneous hydride shift:
Notice that it all happens in one concerted process (via a four-membered transition
state). Let’s take a close look at this first step, and consider the regiochemistry and
stereochemistry.
For the regiochemistry, we notice that the boron ends up on the less substituted
carbon (and that is where the OH group will ultimately end up). Now we can understand
one of the sources of this regiochemical preference. We are adding H and
BH2 across the double bond. BH2 is bigger and bulkier than H, so it will have an easier
time fitting over the less substituted carbon (the less sterically hindered position).
Therefore, we get an anti-Markovnikov addition.
The stereochemical preference (for syn addition) can now also be understood.
The step above represents a concerted process. Both BH2 and H are adding simultaneously,
so they must end up on the same face of the alkene. In other words, the reaction
must be a syn addition.
The structure shown above still has two remaining B¶H bonds (look at the BH2
group), and so the reaction can occur again with those B¶H bonds. In other words,
one molecule of BH3 can react with three molecules of alkene to give a trialkylborane:
What we have done until now (formation of the trialkylborane above) is called hydroboration,
which occurs when you mix an alkene with BH3 in THF. Now, we move

on to the next set of reagents, which accomplish an oxidation reaction: H2O2 and
hydroxide. These reagents give us an oxidation reaction:
How does oxygen insert in between the B¶R bonds? Let’s take a closer look at the
reagents—a hydroxide ion can deprotonate hydrogen peroxide to form a hydroperoxide
anion:
This hydroperoxide anion can attack the trialkylborane (remember that the boron atom
still has an empty p orbital, and therefore, it is still scavenging for electron density):
Now is where it gets interesting. One of the alkyl groups migrates over (an alkyl
shift) to kick off hydroxide:
Notice the overall result. When R migrates over, the net result is to place oxygen in
between B and R. Focus your attention on the stereocenter of the alkyl group (R). As
R migrates, the configuration of the stereocenter is unaffected by the migration. In
other words, the configuration of the stereocenter is preserved. This happens to all
three B¶R bonds:
The final step involves removing the OR groups from B, which happens like this:
RO then removes a proton from water, and the final product is an alcohol. Overall,
we have a two-step synthesis for converting an alkene into an alcohol. This two-step

EXERCISE 11.63 Predict the products for each of the following reactions:
(a) (b)
Answer (a) These reagents will accomplish an anti-Markovnikov addition of OH
and H. The stereochemical outcome will be a syn addition. But we must first decide
whether stereochemistry will even be a relevant factor in how we draw our products.
To do that, remember that we must ask if we are creating two new stereocenters
in this reaction. In this example, we are creating two new stereocenters. So, stereochemistry
is relevant. With two stereocenters, there theoretically could be four possible
products, but we will only get two of them; we will only get the pair of
enantiomers that come from a syn addition. In order to get it right, let’s redraw the
alkene (as we have done many times earlier), and add OH and H like this:
(b) These reagents will accomplish an anti-Markovnikov addition of OH and H. The
stereochemical outcome will be a syn addition. But we must first decide whether
stereochemistry will even be a relevant factor in how we draw our products. To do
this, we ask if two new stereocenters will be forming. In this example, we are not
creating two new stereocenters. In fact, we are not even creating one stereocenter.
So, stereochemistry is not relevant for us in this problem:
Whenever stereochemistry is irrelevant (i.e., whenever we are not creating two new
stereocenters) the problem becomes a bit easier to solve.

In order to begin practicing synthesis problems, it is absolutely essential that you
master all of the individual reactions that we have seen so far. You must learn how
to walk before you can start to run. Therefore, we will first focus on one-step synthesis
problems. Once you feel comfortable with the individual reactions, then we
can start stringing them together in various sequences to form synthesis problems.
Until now, we have seen substitution reactions (SN1 and SN2), elimination
reactions (E1 and E2), and five addition reactions. Let’s quickly review what these
reactions can accomplish. Substitution allows us to interconvert groups:

EXERCISE 11.70 What reagents would you use to accomplish the following
transformation?
Answer If we compare the starting material and product, we see that we must add
H and OH. We look at the regiochemistry, and we see that OH is ending up at the more
substituted carbon—so we need a Markovnikov addition. Then, we look at the stereochemistry
and we see that we are not creating two stereocenters in this reaction (in fact,
we are not even creating one stereocenter). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the reaction
will be irrelevant. So we need to choose reagents that will give a Markovnikov addition
of H and OH. We can accomplish this with an acid-catalyzed hydration:

11.8 SYNTHESIS TECHNIQUES 281
282 CHAPTER 11 ADDITION REACTIONS
The net result is the change in position of the Br atom. It has “moved” over. How
can we accomplish this type of transformation? We don’t have any one-step method
for doing this. Perhaps if we waited long enough, the bromide might leave in an SN1
reaction, and the resulting carbocation could rearrange to become tertiary, and then
bromide could re-attack. But that would take too long. Waiting for an SN1 at a secondary
substrate is not the best idea. We can do this much more quickly and efficiently
if we do it in two steps: We eliminate, and then we add:
When doing this type of sequence, there are a few important things to keep in mind.
In the first step (elimination), we have a choice regarding which way to eliminate:
do we form the more substituted alkene (Zaitsev product) or do we form the less substituted
alkene (Hofmann product):
We can control which product we get by carefully choosing our base. If we use a
strong base (like methoxide or ethoxide), then we will get the more substituted
alkene. However, if we use a strong, sterically hindered base, such as tert-butoxide,
then we will get the less substituted alkene.
After forming the double bond, we must also carefully consider the regiochemistry
of how we add HBr across the double bond. Once again, by carefully
choosing our reagents, we can control the regiochemical outcome. We can either use
HBr to force a Markovnikov addition, or we can use HBr with peroxides to force an
anti-Markovnikov addition. Let’s see an example:
EXERCISE 11.79 What reagents would you use to accomplish the following
transformation?
Answer This problem requires that we move the Br over to the left. We can
accomplish this by eliminating first (to form a double bond), and then adding across
that double bond:
Br
Br
NaOEt
Br
Zaitsev
Hofmann
t-BuOK

eliminate add Br
However, we must be careful to control the regiochemistry properly in each of these
two steps. In the elimination step, we need to form the less substituted double bond
(i.e., the Hofmann product), and therefore, we must use a sterically hindered base.
Then, in the addition step, we need to place the Br on the less substituted carbon
(anti-Markovnikov addition), so we must use HBr with peroxides. This gives us the
following overall synthesis:
There is one more thing to keep in mind when using this type of technique:
hydroxide is a terrible leaving group. Let’s see what to do when dealing with an OH
group. As an example, suppose we wanted to do the following transformation:
Our technique would suggest the following steps:
The first step of our technique requires an elimination reaction to give the Hofmann
product, so we must use an E2 reaction, employing a sterically hindered base. In
order to do this, we must first convert the OH group into a good leaving group. This
can be accomplished by converting the OH group into a tosylate, which is a much
better leaving group than OH:
If you have not yet learned about tosylates in your lecture course, you might want to
consult your textbook for more information on tosylates.

transformation?
Answer In this example, we are tasked with moving the position of a double
bond. We have not seen a way to do the transformation above in one step. However,
we can easily accomplish it with two steps—add and then eliminate:
In the first step above, we need a Markovnikov addition (Br needs to end up at the
more substituted carbon), which we can easily accomplish by using HBr. The second
step requires an elimination to give the Zaitsev product, which we can accomplish if
we choose our base carefully (we will need to use a base that is NOT sterically hindered).
Therefore, the overall synthesis is:
Take special notice of what we can accomplish when we use this technique: it gives
us the power to move the position of a double bond. When using this technique, we
must carefully consider the regiochemistry of each step. In the first step (addition),
we must decide whether we want a Markovnikov addition (HBr), or an anti-
Markovnikov addition (HBr with peroxides). Also, in the second step (elimination),
we must decide whether we want to form the Zaitsev product or the Hofmann product
(which we can control by carefully choosing our base, ethoxide or tert-butoxide).

11.8D Introducing Functionality
In the techniques we have seen so far, the starting compound always had some
functional group that we could manipulate. Either the starting material had a leaving
group or it had a double bond. But what about situations in which the starting
material has no functional groups—no leaving group, and no double bond? What
can be done? In situations like this, there is only one possible course of action to
take: radical bromination. Let’s see an example:
EXERCISE 11.91 What reagents would you use to accomplish the following
transformation?
Answer In this problem, we are starting with an alkane. There are no leaving
groups, so we cannot do a substitution or an elimination reaction. There are also no
double bonds, so we cannot do an addition. It seems that we are stuck, with nothing
to do. Clearly, our only way out of this situation is to introduce a functional group
into the compound, via radical bromination. Radical bromination will place a Br at
the most substituted position (the tertiary position), and then we can eliminate:
So, our overall synthesis is:
There are a few things to keep in mind when using this technique. First of all,
radical bromination will selectively place a Br on the most substituted position.
Therefore, you should always look for the tertiary position to see where the Br will
go. Then, when doing the elimination, make sure to choose the base carefully, in
order to achieve the desired regiochemistry. Let’s get some practice with this.

11.9 ADDING Br AND Br;

We now turn our attention to the next addition reaction: adding Br and Br across a
double bond:
We will begin by analyzing the regiochemistry and stereochemistry of the above reaction.
The regiochemistry will be irrelevant, regardless of what alkene we start
with, because we are adding two of the same group (Br and Br). However, the stereochemistry
is relevant, because we are creating two new stereocenters in the example
above. If we carefully examine the products, we will notice that we have a pair of
enantiomers. (Caution: Many students mistakenly believe that these two products
are the same, but they are not—they are in fact enantiomers.) Our products represent
the pair of enantiomers that we would get from an anti addition. So, we must try to

11.9 ADDING Br AND Br; ADDING Br AND OH 287
288 CHAPTER 11 ADDITION REACTIONS
understand why this reaction proceeds through an anti addition. To do this, we turn
once again to the mechanism.
In the first step, we have an alkene reacting with Br2. To understand this step
of the mechanism, we must determine which reagent is the nucleophile, and which
reagent is the electrophile. The alkene possesses a pi bond, which represents a region
in space of electron density. Therefore, the alkene functions as the nucleophile.
This implies that Br2 is the electrophile. But how does Br2 function as an electrophile?
The bond between the two bromine atoms is a covalent bond, and we therefore
expect the electron density to be equally distributed over both Br atoms.
However, an interesting thing happens when a Br2 molecule approaches an alkene.
The electron density of the pi bond repels the electron density in the Br2 molecule,
creating a temporary dipole moment in Br2.
As the Br2 molecule gets closer to the alkene, this temporary effect becomes more
pronounced. Now we can understand why Br2 functions as an electrophile in this reaction:
there is a temporary d on the bromine atom that is closer to the pi bond of
the alkene. When the electron-rich alkene attacks the electron-poor bromine, we get
the following first step of our mechanism:
Notice that there are three curved arrows here. For some reason, students drawing
this mechanism commonly forget to draw the third curved arrow (the one that shows
the expulsion of Br). The product of this first step is a bridged, positively charged
intermediate, called a bromonium ion (“onium” because there is a positive charge).
In the second step of our mechanism, the bromonium ion gets attacked by Br
(formed in the first step):
This step is simply an SN2, and therefore, must be a back-side attack. In other words,
the attacking bromide ion must come from behind (from behind the bridge), and
therefore, we get an anti addition. There are some alkenes for which a syn addition
predominates. Clearly, a different mechanism is operating in those cases. For the
alkenes that you will encounter in this course, this reaction will always be an anti addition,
proceeding via the mechanism that we showed.

mechanism.
The first step is identical to what we saw just a few moments ago: the alkene
attacks Br2 to form a bridged, bromonium intermediate. But now we have a new possibility,
because there are now two nucleophiles present: bromide and water. Rather
than Br attacking the bromonium ion, a water molecule can attack instead, which
will ultimately give the products shown above. The obvious question is: Why should
H2O attack instead of bromide? Isn’t bromide a better nucleophile? Yes, it is true that
bromide is a better nucleophile than H2O. However, think about it from the point of
view of a bromonium ion. It is a very high-energy intermediate (it has ring strain
from the three-membered ring, and it has a positive charge on a bromine atom).
Therefore, it is very eager to react with any nucleophile. It will not be very picky. It
will react with the first nucleophile that it encounters. Since we are using water as
the solvent here, the bromonium ion will most likely encounter a water molecule before
it has a chance to get attacked by a bromide ion.
In the absence of water, we did not need to think about regiochemistry, because
we were adding Br and Br. But now, in the presence of water, we are adding
Br and OH (two different groups). As a result, the regiochemistry will be relevant if
we start with an unsymmetrical alkene—for example,
Which group will end up on the more substituted carbon? Br or OH? In other words,
does water attack the more substituted carbon or the less substituted carbon? To answer
this question, we need to look at the structure of the bromonium ion more

carefully than we did earlier. When we drew the bromonium ion earlier, the positively
charged bromine atom was drawn to form a perfect three-membered ring (a
nice triangle). But the bromine does not have to be in the center; it can lean to one
side or the other:
Imagine if the bromine atom were leaning all the way to one side. That would just
give us a carbocation:
It does not actually lean completely to one side, but it does lean a little toward one
side—which gives more “carbocationic character” to the tertiary carbon:
The more substituted carbon (the tertiary carbon) can best handle this carbocationic
character. Therefore, the more substituted carbon will possess more d
than the less substituted carbon. This means that the tertiary carbon atom will be
close in character to an sp2 hybridized carbon atom. It is not a full-fledged carbocation,
so it is not fully sp2 hybridized. But it is also not a regular sp3
hybridized carbon. Rather, it is somewhere in between these two extremes (somewhere
in between sp2 and sp3). Therefore, the geometry will not really be trigonal
planar, nor will it be tetrahedral either. The geometry of the tertiary carbon atom
above will be somewhere in between trigonal planar and tetrahedral. This helps
explain how we can have an SN2 attack at a tertiary center in the second step of
the mechanism. Normally, we can’t have an SN2 at a tertiary center. But here it’s
OK, because the geometry is closer to being trigonal planar, which allows water
to attack:

As a final step, deprotonation gives our product:
Notice that we use water to pull off the proton—we do not use hydroxide (HO), because
there isn’t much hydroxide around. It is always important to stay consistent
with the conditions that are stated. In this case, the reagents are Br2 and H2O (not hydroxide).
Therefore, we must use H2O as a base to pull off the proton.
The final product is called a halohydrin (indicating that we have a halogen—
Br—and an OH in the same compound). This reaction is commonly called halohydrin
formation.

the mechanism and justified why the reaction must be an anti addition. So, we must

11.10 ADDING OH AND OH, ANTI
Now we will see how to add two OH groups across an alkene. It is possible to control
whether the OH groups add via a syn addition, or via an anti addition (by choosing
which reagents we will use to add the OH groups). In this section, we will learn
how to add two OH groups in an anti addition. In the next section, we will learn how
to add two OH groups in a syn addition.
To add two OH groups in an anti addition, we will employ a two-step process:
we will first make an epoxide, and then we will open the epoxide with water under
conditions of acid-catalysis:
We will now explore each aspect of this two-step process. In the first step, a
peroxyacid (RCO3H), sometimes called a per-acid, reacts with the alkene. Compare
the structure of a carboxylic acid with the structure of a peroxy acid:

Peroxy acids resemble carboxylic acids in structure, possessing just one additional
oxygen atom. Peroxy acids are not very acidic, but they are used as strong oxidizing
agents. Common examples of peroxy acids are:
The second example above is called meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA). It is
perhaps the most common example in this course. Whenever you see MCPBA, you
should immediately recognize it as an example of a peroxy acid. Similarly, whenever
you see RCO3H, you should also see it as the generic formula for a peroxy
acid.
Peroxy acids will react with an alkene to form an epoxide. The mechanism is
somewhat complicated, and may or may not be in your textbook, depending on
which textbook you are using.
You will not see many mechanisms that are quite as complicated as this one,
so we will not spend time on this mechanism. Let’s turn our attention to the product
of this reaction. We call the product an epoxide, which is the fancy term for a threemembered,
cyclic ether.
We then take this epoxide and open it with water under conditions of acidcatalysis.
Let’s explore the mechanism of how this occurs. First, the epoxide is
protonated:
This proton transfer step produces an intermediate that is very similar to a bromonium
ion (a three-membered ring with a positive charge on an electronegative atom).
Just as a bromonium ion can be attacked by water, similarly, a protonated epoxide
can also be attacked by water:
Once again (just like the attack of the bromonium ion in the previous section), water
must attack from the back side, which explains the observed stereochemical preference
for anti addition.
As a final step, we just need to deprotonate:

Once again, notice that we use water to deprotonate (rather than using hydroxide) in
order to stay consistent with the conditions. In acidic conditions, we most certainly
cannot use hydroxide ions in our mechanism.
Now we can summarize the profile for the two-step synthesis that we saw in
this section:

11.11 ADDING OH AND OH, SYN
In the previous section, we saw how to perform an anti addition of OH and OH
across a double bond. In this section, we will explore the conditions that will allow
us to perform a syn addition of OH and OH across a double bond. This reaction is
often called a syn hydroxylation.
Consider the following example:
In this example, the OH groups clearly added in a syn addition. In order to explain
why this reaction proceeds via a syn addition, we must look at the first step of the

It is this first step that allows us to understand why the reaction follows a syn addition.
In this step, osmium tetroxide (OsO4) adds across the alkene in a concerted
process. In other words, both oxygen atoms attach to the alkene simultaneously. This
effectively adds two groups across the same face of the alkene.
The pertinent details of this reaction can be summarized in the following
chart:

The same transformation (syn addition of OH and OH) can also be accomplished
with cold KMnO4 and hydroxide. Again, we will only look at the first step of the
mechanism:
Once again, we have a concerted process that adds both oxygen atoms simultaneously
across the double bond. Notice the similarity between the mechanisms of these
two methods (OsO4 vs. KMnO4).
EXERCISE 11.110 Predict the products for each of the reactions below:
Answer In this reaction, we are adding two OH groups, so we don’t need to think
about regiochemistry. As always, stereochemistry will only be relevant if we are

and therefore, we must be careful to draw only the pair of enantiomers that represent

OF AN ALKENE
There are many reagents that will add across an alkene and completely cleave the
C¨C bond. In this section, we will learn about one such reaction, called ozonolysis.
Consider the following example:
Notice that the C¨C bond is completely split apart to form two C¨O double bonds.
Therefore, issues of stereochemistry or regiochemistry become irrelevant. In order
to understand how this reaction occurs, we must first explore the reagents.

Ozone is a compound with the following resonance structures:
Ozone is formed primarily in the upper atmosphere, where oxygen gas (O2) is bombarded
with ultraviolet light.
As we did in the previous sections, we will only explore the first step of the
mechanism:
Compare this step to the mechanisms we saw in the previous section (syn dihydroxylation),
and you should see striking similarities. The initial product (shown above) is
called a molozonide, and it subsequently undergoes further rearrangements, before
ultimately giving the product upon treatment with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). The
structure of DMS is:
DMS is a mild reducing agent. There are many other reducing agents that can be
used in the final step of an ozonolysis, but DMS is common.
There is a simple technique for drawing the products of an ozonolysis: just split
up each C¨C bond into two C¨O bonds. Let’s see an example of how this works:

SUMMARY OF REACTIONS 301
Alcohols are compounds containing an OH group. In this chapter, we will learn how
to make alcohols, and we will learn how to convert alcohols into a variety of other
compounds.
12.1 NAMING AND DESIGNATING ALCOHOLS
We saw how to name alcohols in Chapter 5, when we learned the basic rules of nomenclature.
In addition to their names, alcohols are also often classified into the following
categories:
This designation scheme (primary, secondary, or tertiary) indicates the degree of substitution
of the carbon atom bearing the OH, called the alpha () carbon. This will become
important later in this chapter when we explore reactions of alcohols. Specifically,
we will encounter reactions where the designation (primary, secondary, or tertiary) will
affect the reaction outcome.
EXERCISE 12.1 Identify whether the following alcohol is primary, secondary, or
tertiary:

case, there are two alkyl groups:

12.2 PREDICTING SOLUBILITY
OF ALCOHOLS
An alcohol, by definition, will contain an OH group in its structure. Therefore, we
expect hydrogen bonding to occur:
Hydrogen bonding does NOT refer to a type of bond (even though it is called hydrogen
bonding). This terminology is somewhat misleading. H-bonding actually
refers to a force of attraction between molecules (an intermolecular force). This
attraction is temporary, or fleeting, in the liquid and gaseous states. As two alcohol
molecules approach each other, they are momentarily attracted to one another. At
low enough temperatures (if the alcohol is a solid), then these forces will actually
hold together the alcohol molecules in a crystalline state. But in the liquid or
gaseous state, the molecules are bouncing off each other, and they are NOT permanently
held together.

12.2 PREDICTING SOLUBILITY OF ALCOHOLS 303
Why the misleading terminology (H-bonding)? At some point during your
high school studies, you were likely exposed to a model of the DNA helix, which
looks like a twisted ladder. That twisted ladder is actually two very large molecules
(each of which is like a piece of cooked spaghetti), twisted around each other. Each
rung of the ladder is a hydrogen bonding interaction between the two molecules.
Each individual H-bond, by itself, would not be strong enough to hold the two large
molecules together. However, the cumulative effect (of millions of H-bonds) holds
the two molecules together in a twisted helix. Perhaps this can help us understand
why we call these interactions (the rungs of the ladder) hydrogen bonding. This also
explains why it is so easy to “unzip” the helix.
You might learn about the structure of DNA at the end of your organic chemistry
course. For right now, we will be focused on problems that deal primarily with
small molecules; and therefore, for our purposes, we should think of H-bonding as
an interaction; a type of intermolecular force.
For any given alcohol, the strength of the H-bonding interactions will be
greatly dependent on concentration. For a concentrated alcohol, there will be a fairly
decent amount of H-bonding interactions at any given moment in time. However, if
we dilute the alcohol in a solvent that cannot form hydrogen bonding interactions
with the alcohol, then the H-bonding effect will be minimal:
Now consider diluting an alcohol in a solvent that can form hydrogen bonding interactions
with the alcohol (for example, a solvent such as water). In such a case, the
interaction is indeed very strong (it is similar to the effect of having a concentrated
alcohol). This explains why methanol is miscible with water. The term miscible
means that methanol can be mixed with water (they will dissolve in each other) in
all proportions. However, not all alcohols are miscible with water. In fact, just the
very small alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, and tert-butanol) are miscible with
water. To understand why, we must realize that every alcohol has two regions. The
hydrophobic region, which does not interact well with water, and the hydrophilic
region, which does interact well with water:

304 CHAPTER 12 ALCOHOLS
12.2 PREDICTING SOLUBILITY OF ALCOHOLS 305
In the case of methanol, the hydrophobic end of the molecule is fairly small. This
is true even of ethanol and propanol. But an interesting thing happens when we look
at 1-butanol. The hydrophobic end of the molecule is now large enough to prevent
miscibility:
Water and 1-butanol will mix, but not in all proportions. That is, 1-butanol is considered
to be soluble in water, rather than miscible. The term soluble means that only
a certain volume of 1-butanol will dissolve in a specified amount of water at room
temperature.
As we consider an even larger hydrophobic region, solubility decreases. For
example, 1-octanol has a very low solubility in water at room temperature:
Here is a rule of thumb that can help us predict solubility: in order to have a high
water-solubility, there should be no more than 5 carbon atoms per OH group. A
compound with two OH groups and 7 carbon atoms will be very soluble in water.
A compound with one OH group and 7 carbon atoms will NOT be very soluble in
water. There are, of course, many exceptions to this simplified rule of thumb, but
the rule can be helpful whenever we need to make a quick prediction about the
solubility of an alcohol.
EXERCISE 12.6 Predict whether the following alcohol will have a high or low
solubility in water:
ANSWER This compound has eight carbon atoms, and only one OH group. The
hydrophobic region of the molecule is too large, and we expect the molecule to exhibit
very low water solubility.

12.3 PREDICTING RELATIVE ACIDITY
OF ALCOHOLS
As we learned in Chapter 3, in order to determine the relative acidity of a compound,
we must carefully assess the stability of its conjugate base. For example:
When we draw the conjugate base of an alcohol (as we did above), we see that the
negative charge is on an oxygen atom. This is much more stable than a negative
charge on a nitrogen atom, but it is not as stable as a negative charge on a halogen:
Therefore, in terms of acidity, alcohols will lie somewhere between amines and
hydrogen halides:
The pKa for most alcohols will fall in the range of 15-18. Remember, a low pKa value
means that a compound is fairly acidic, and a high pKa value means that it is not very
acidic. Compare the following pKa values:

12.3 PREDICTING RELATIVE ACIDITY OF ALCOHOLS 307
In Chapter 3, we learned how to analyze the four factors that stabilize a negative
charge (ARIO). The “I” in ARIO stood for “induction.” We saw that neighboring
halogens can withdraw electron density and stabilize the negative charge:
Therefore, the presence of halogens can lower the pKa value of an alcohol to around
14. In other words, the presence of a halogen will make the compound more acidic.
The following two alcohols provide an interesting comparison:
The pKa of cyclohexanol is 18, whereas the pKa of phenol is 10. This means that
phenol is eight orders of magnitude more acidic than cyclohexanol. In other words,
phenol is 100 million times more acidic than cyclohexanol. Why is there such a
huge difference? We can understand why cyclohexanol has a pKa of 18, because
that is within the expected range of an alcohol (15–18). So the real question is:
why is the pKa of phenol so low? Why is phenol so much more acidic than a regular
alcohol? To answer this question, we will use the “R” of ARIO (Resonance)
to explain the acidity of phenol:
The conjugate base of phenol is stabilized by resonance. This explains why phenolic
protons are more acidic than typical alcoholic protons.

the conjugate base in each case, and then we will compare those conjugate bases,
using our four factors (ARIO):
In both cases, the negative charge is on an oxygen atom, so our first factor (ARIO)
does not help. Neither structure is stabilized by resonance, so our second factor
(ARIO) also does not help. In this case, it is the third factor (induction) that indicates
which structure is more stable. Both conjugate bases are stabilized by the
electron-withdrawing effects of the two fluorine atoms. But the more stable conjugate
base is the one where the two fluorine atoms are closer to the negatively
charged oxygen atom:
Therefore, we expect the following highlighted proton to be the most acidic proton:

We will learn many ways of making alcohols in this chapter. First, let’s review the
various reactions that we have already learned in previous chapters. All of these reactions
can be used to produce an alcohol:

you remember the methods that you have already learned (above). Let’s get some
practice:

12.5 PREPARING ALCOHOLS
VIA REDUCTION
In this section, we will learn how to prepare alcohols through a reduction process. In
order to understand what the word reduction means, we must go back and review
what oxidation states are. We will do that now:
There are two methods for counting electrons: formal charge and oxidation
state. These two counting methods actually represent two flipsides of the same coin.
To calculate formal charge, we treat all bonds as covalent, regardless of whether they
are or not:
When we treat all bonds as covalent, the carbon atom appears to have four electrons
of its own. Carbon is supposed to have four valence electrons. When we compare
how many electrons carbon actually has with the number of electrons it is supposed
to have, we see that everything is just right in this case. It is supposed to have four
valence electrons, and it is clearly using four valence electrons. Therefore, there is
no formal charge.

(all covalent bonds)
12.5 PREPARING ALCOHOLS VIA REDUCTION 311
On the flipside, we will now calculate the oxidation state of the same carbon
atom. To calculate the oxidation state of an atom, we treat all bonds as ionic, regardless
of whether they are or not:
For each bond, we give both electrons to the more electronegative atom. For the
CˆCl bond, chlorine is more electronegative, so chlorine gets both electrons. For
each of the CˆH bonds, carbon is very slightly more electronegative than hydrogen,
so carbon will get both electrons in each case. But for the CˆC bond, neither atom
is more electronegative than the other, so we must place one electron on each carbon
atom. Now when we count the electrons, it appears as though the carbon atom is
using five electrons of its own. But we know that carbon is only supposed to have
four valence electrons. This carbon atom is using one extra electron, and therefore,
this carbon atom will have an oxidation state of -1.
Formal charges and oxidation states represent two different ways of estimating
electron density. Neither method is perfectly accurate. Each method assumes an
extreme that is not true. Formal charges are calculated based on the assumption that
all bonds are covalent (generally an incorrect assumption), and oxidation states are
calculated based on the assumption that all bonds are ionic (generally an incorrect
assumption). Earlier in this book, we focused our attention on formal charges exclusively.
For purposes of this section, we will now focus our attention exclusively on
oxidation states.
Carbon can range in oxidation state from 4 to 4:
The oxidation state of the carbon atom in an alcohol will be dependent on the identities
of the atoms that are attached to the carbon atom. Here are some examples

Let’s get practice:
EXERCISE 12.23 Calculate the oxidation state of the carbon atom highlighted
below:
ANSWER For each bond, we give both electrons to the more electronegative atom.
For the CˆO bond, oxygen is more electronegative, so oxygen gets both electrons.
For each of the CˆC bonds, we treat the electrons as being shared equally (one electron
on one carbon atom, and the other electron on the other carbon atom). For the
CˆH bond, carbon is very slightly more electronegative than hydrogen, so carbon
will get both electrons.
When we count the electrons that carbon is using now, it appears as though the carbon
atom is using four electrons of its own. Next, we compare that number to the
number of valence electrons that carbon is supposed to have (four valence electrons).
This carbon atom is using exactly the right number of electrons, and therefore, this
carbon atom will have an oxidation state of 0.

12.5 PREPARING ALCOHOLS VIA REDUCTION 313
Notice the trend. Let’s ignore the two extremes above (alkane and carbon dioxide), and
let’s focus on the middle three compounds: alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids.
Carboxylic acids are at a higher oxidation state than aldehydes, which in turn, are at
a higher oxidation state than alcohols. Now imagine that we are running a reaction that
converts an alcohol into an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. This reaction would constitute
an increase in oxidation state. Whenever we run a reaction that increases the oxidation
state, we say that an oxidation has occurred. Therefore, converting a primary
alcohol into an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid is called an oxidation:
Similarly, it is also called an oxidation when we convert a secondary alcohol into a
ketone:
In order to accomplish an oxidation, there is always some other compound that must
itself get reduced (that compound is called the oxidizing agent, because it causes the
desired oxidation).
Whenever we run a reaction that involves a decrease in oxidation state, we say
that a reduction has occurred. For example, converting a ketone or aldehyde into an
alcohol:

314 CHAPTER 12 ALCOHOLS
Notice that the product of reducing a C¨O bond is simply an alcohol. Therefore,
we can make alcohols by reducing ketones or aldehydes. To accomplish this
reduction, we will need a reducing agent. There are two common reagents for doing
this. In order to understand the structures of these reagents, let’s quickly review
something from the periodic table. The elements boron and aluminum are in the
same column of the periodic table (just to the left of carbon):
Each of these elements (boron and aluminum) has three valence electrons. Therefore,
each of these elements can comfortably form three bonds:
In the compounds shown above, boron and aluminum are using their valence electrons
to form bonds, but notice that neither one has an octet. Each element is capable
of forming a fourth bond in order to obtain an octet, but then each element will bear
a formal charge of –1.
In both of these compounds, the central atom (B or Al) has four bonds and a negative
charge. In the first compound (NaBH4), Na is used as the counter-ion. In the
second compound (LAH), Li is used as the counter-ion. The choice of counterion
is usually not relevant for our discussion, and we will choose to ignore it from
now on.
Either one of these reagents (NaBH4 or LAH) can attack a ketone or aldehyde
to give an alcohol:

12.5 PREPARING ALCOHOLS VIA REDUCTION 315
The mechanisms are somewhat complex and beyond the scope of our course,
but the following simplified mechanism will be useful:
As we carefully analyze the first step of this mechanism, we see that the reducing
agent (LAH) is simply functioning as a source of H. The mechanism of this first
step is the same whether we use LAH or NaBH4. Then, in the second step, a proton
source is used to generate the alcohol.
We have now seen the way that LAH and NaBH4 work. Essentially, they are
both just sources of nucleophilic H. You might wonder why we can’t just use
sodium hydride (NaH), like this:
This actually doesn’t work well. Recall (Chapter 10) that nucleophilicity is dependent
on polarizability (the size of the atom). Large atoms (like sulfur or iodine)
are very polarizable, and therefore, they are excellent nucleophiles. Small atoms
are not polarizable, and they make poor nucleophiles. H is as small as they come,
and therefore H is not a great nucleophile. H is a good base (in fact, it is an excellent
base), but it is not a good nucleophile. So, we use LAH or NaBH4 as a
“source” of nucleophilic H. We can think of LAH and NaBH4 as delivery agents
of nucleophilic H.
Although we can use either reagent to reduce a ketone or aldehyde, nevertheless,
there are striking differences between LAH and NaBH4. LAH is much more
reactive than NaBH4. If we look at the structure of LAH, we see that the central atom
(bearing the negative charge) is aluminum. By contrast, in NaBH4, the negative
charge is on boron. Aluminum is much larger (more polarizable) than boron, and
therefore, LAH is much more reactive. The higher reactivity of LAH is a topic that
will be important in the second semester of organic chemistry. For now, the difference
in reactivity is less apparent, because both LAH and NaBH4 will react with
ketones and aldehydes to give alcohols.
For purposes of our discussion here, there is one noticeable difference between
LAH and NaBH4. Whenever we use LAH, we must provide a proton source
after the reaction (after LAH has had a chance to attack the ketone or aldehyde),
because LAH is so reactive that it would violently react with water. However,
when we use NaBH4 (the milder reducing agent), we do not have to worry about

NaBH4 reacting with the proton source. The proton source (methanol is often
used) can be present in the reaction flask at the same time as NaBH4. This is shown
in the following way:
Notice that with LAH, two separate steps are required.
So far, we have seen two sources of nucleophilic H (LAH and NaBH4). There
are many, many other hydride reagents that have been prepared (some that are even
more reactive than LAH, and others that are even milder than NaBH4), for example:
By carefully choosing the R groups above (to be either electron-donating groups or
electron-withdrawing groups), we can very carefully control the reactivity of the hydride
reagent. For now, we will simply focus our attention on the two commonly
used hydride reagents: LAH and NaBH4.
Let’s do some problems where we use LAH or NaBH4 to reduce ketones or
aldehydes into alcohols.

318 CHAPTER 12 ALCOHOLS
Both H and R can attack a ketone or aldehyde to give an alcohol. The main difference
is the effect on the carbon skeleton. With H, the carbon skeleton does not
change at all. But with R, the carbon skeleton gets larger. We are forming a CˆC
bond. We will soon see that this is very important for synthesis problems. For now,
let’s focus on how we can make R in the first place. After all, a negative charge on
a carbon atom is not very stable (and therefore not trivial to make).
There are many ways to get a negative charge on a carbon atom. Later in this
course, you will spend a lot of time learning about special C compounds. For now,
we will just learn about one such compound, called a Grignard reagent:
where R is an alkyl group. In a Grignard reagent, there is a carbon atom that is directly
connected to a magnesium atom. If we compare the electronegativity values of
C and Mg, we will see that C is much more electronegative than Mg. Therefore, carbon
pulls more strongly on the electron density and will develop a negative charge.
Grignard reagents are formed by inserting magnesium in between a CˆX
bond (where X is a halogen):
The mechanism for this insertion of magnesium is beyond the scope of this course,
and therefore, we will not go into it. For now, we should just know that we can insert
Mg into a CˆX bond (where X is Cl, Br, or I). Here are some examples:

12.6 PREPARING ALCOHOLS VIA GRIGNARD REACTIONS 319
Once a magnesium atom is inserted between a CˆX bond, the newly formed
CˆMg bond is somewhat ionic in character (because carbon is so much more electronegative
than magnesium). Therefore, there are two acceptable ways to draw a
Grignard reagent:
Neither drawing is absolutely correct. The first drawing assumes a perfectly covalent
bond, which is certainly not accurate. The second drawing assumes an ionic bond.
The reality actually lies somewhere in between these two extremes, although it is a
lot closer to being ionic.
When a Grignard reagent attacks a ketone or aldehyde, it forms an alcohol,
with a newly installed R group:
Here are two specific examples:
Grignard reagents also attack other compounds possessing a C¨O bond (such as
esters) to produce alcohols. For now, let’s just focus on Grignard reagents attacking
ketones and aldehydes.

that have only one solution. More often, we will find synthesis problems that
have more than one acceptable answer.

12.6 PREPARING ALCOHOLS VIA GRIGNARD REACTIONS 321
In this section, we learned that a Grignard reagent can attack a ketone or aldehyde
to give an alcohol. This reaction is so incredibly important because we are not only
converting a C¨O bond into an alcohol, but we are also introducing an R group into
the compound:
This is a CˆC bond-forming reaction. Until now, we have only seen one kind of CˆC
bond-forming reaction (the alkylation of terminal alkynes). Now we have a second approach
for creating a CˆC bond. We must put this reaction into our synthetic “toolbag.”
Whenever we have a synthesis problem, we must always ask two questions: is
there a change in the carbon skeleton, and is there change in the functional group (as
we will see in the next chapter). If we have a synthesis problem where the carbon
skeleton is getting larger, then we know we will have to create a CˆC bond. And so
far in this book, we have seen two ways to do that. We can alkylate a terminal alkyne,
or we can use a Grignard reagent to attack a ketone or aldehyde.
You must make sure that you have this reaction at your fingertips, since it
will appear several times throughout the rest of your organic chemistry course.
Let’s practice a bit. We will begin with a few problems that are just one-step syntheses
(Grignard) to make sure you got it. Then, the last two problems in this problem
set will be multi-step syntheses (using a Grignard reaction and other reactions
we have seen).

12.8 REACTIONS OF ALCOHOLS:
SUBSTITUTION AND ELIMINATION
Now that we have seen how to make alcohols, we will focus our attention on reactions
of alcohols. Let’s start by reviewing reactions that we have already seen:
substitution and elimination. Let’s begin our review with elimination reactions
first. We have seen two types of elimination reactions: E1 an E2.
To eliminate an OH group under E1 conditions, we need acidic conditions:
In this reaction, acidic conditions are used in order to protonate the OH group, effectively
converting the OH group into an excellent leaving group. Then, the leaving
group leaves to give an intermediate carbocation, which then loses a proton to give
conc. H

the alkene (for a review of this mechanism, see Chapter 10). Because the E1 mechanism
involves an intermediate carbocation, this reaction works well with a tertiary
alcohol, although it can also be achieved with secondary alcohols.
For primary alcohols, we will not be able to form a carbocation. Therefore, we
generally cannot use an E1 reaction on primary alcohols. Instead, we use an E2 reaction.
But we still have the same problem—OH is still a terrible leaving group. We
took care of that problem in an E1 reaction by protonating the OH group. In an E2 reaction,
we will also need to convert the OH group a better leaving group. But we cannot
use a proton source, because that would be incompatible with the strongly basic
conditions that are required in order to perform an E2 process. Therefore, if we want
to use E2 conditions, we will first need to convert the OH group into a tosylate group:
In the last step, tert-butoxide was used to favor elimination over substitution (see
Section 10.10). In summary, we have seen that we can use either an E1 process or
an E2 process to convert an alcohol into an alkene.
Now let’s consider substitution reactions involving alcohols:
If we want to perform a substitution reaction with an alcohol, we have the same issue
that we had when we explored elimination reactions a few moments ago—the OH
group is not a good leaving group. So, we must convert the OH into a better leaving
group. There are several ways to do that for substitution reactions. We will look at
four different ways:
1) Via an SN1 process. With a tertiary alcohol, we can use an SN1 process.
We simply use an acid to protonate the OH group, converting it into an excellent
leaving group. The first two steps of this reaction are identical to the
E1 process that we just saw:
2) Via an SN2 process. With primary or secondary alcohols, we can still
protonate the OH group and get a substitution reaction (it will just be
SN2 instead of SN1):

12.8 REACTIONS OF ALCOHOLS: SUBSTITUTION AND ELIMINATION 325
In this reaction, a carbocation would be too unstable to form. After protonating
the OH group (converting it into a better leaving group), the leaving group
is expelled when the nucleophile attacks, in an SN2 process.
This reaction works well with HBr, but it does not work so well with
HCl. Chloride is smaller than bromide, and therefore, chloride is less polarizable
than bromide. This means that chloride is not as nucleophilic as bromide.
Although chloride is still fairly nucleophilic, the reaction is slow, and we can
help it along with a catalyst, such as ZnCl2:
The effect of ZnCl2 is similar to the effect of protonating an OH group, but
ZnCl2 just does a better job than H:
3) A third way to perform a substitution reaction is to convert the OH group
into a tosylate, and then do an SN2 reaction:
4) There is one other way to convert an OH group into a better leaving group
for the purpose of doing a substitution reaction. We can use thionyl chloride
(SOCl2) to convert an alcohol into an alkyl chloride:

Notice that the first three steps simply convert a bad leaving group into a good leaving
group. Also notice that SO2 (a gas) is produced as a side product. This gas can
escape from the reaction flask, thereby pushing the equilibrium toward formation of
products. In fact, if the gas is free to leave as it is formed, the reaction will be pushed
to completion.
This last reaction might seem like a new reaction. But it really is not so new.
It is just an SN2 reaction where the OH group is first converted into a better leaving
group, and then chloride functions as the nucleophile. This reaction is really not all
that much different than converting the OH group into a tosylate and then attacking
with chloride. The only practical difference is this: when we use SOCl2, everything
happens in one reaction (convert the OH group into a better leaving group, and
chloride attacks).
In this section, we have started looking at reactions of alcohols. So far in this
section, we have focused on the details of familiar reactions (substitution and elimination).
Before we learn some new reactions, let’s practice the ones that we just reviewed:
EXERCISE 12.57 Identify the reagents you would use to achieve the following
transformation:
ANSWER We are forming an alkene, so we must perform an elimination reaction.
This problem requires an elimination with specific regiochemistry. We must form the
less substituted alkene (the Hofmann product). Therefore, we will need to use a sterically
hindered base (tert-butoxide). The obstacle is that an OH group is a terrible
leaving group. So, we must first convert the OH group into a better leaving group.
We can do that by converting it into a tosylate, which will then undergo elimination
when treated with tert-butoxide:

12.9 REACTIONS OF ALCOHOLS:
OXIDATION
Earlier in this chapter, we learned definitions for the terms oxidation and reduction.
We saw that oxidation involves an increase in oxidation state. For example, oxidation
of a secondary alcohol will produce a ketone:
Notice the term used over the arrow, [O]. This term means that we are performing an
oxidation. There are many oxidizing agents that can be used to accomplish this transformation.
Chromic acid (H2CrO4) is a good example. Chromic acid can be formed
from mixing sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7) and sulfuric acid:
In the example above, a secondary alcohol was oxidized to give a ketone. However,
when we start with a primary alcohol, we will have two choices: 1) we can
oxidize to give an aldehyde, or 2) we can oxidize even further to the carboxylic
acid:
We can control how far we oxidize by carefully choosing our reagents. If we want
to go all the way up to a carboxylic acid, then we just use chromic acid:

However, if we want to stop at the aldehyde, we will have to use a milder oxidizing
agent. There are many such reagents that will oxidize a primary alcohol to
give an aldehyde (and will not oxidize the aldehyde further to give a carboxylic
acid):
One such example is pyridinium chlorochromate, or PCC for short, which is prepared
in the following way:
PCC is a mild oxidizing agent, and it will oxidize a primary alcohol to give an aldehyde.
For example:

Alcohols can be deprotonated with a strong base:
A fairly strong base is required to deprotonate an alcohol. By removing the proton,
we are forming a negative charge on an oxygen atom (an alkoxide ion). Therefore, in

order to deprotonate, we will need a base that is even stronger than an alkoxide ion.
As an example, we can use a base with a negative charge on a nitrogen atom, such as
sodium amide (NaNH2):
However, there is a simpler way to deprotonate an alcohol. We can just use elemental
sodium (Na), like this:
Elemental sodium (Na) has one electron which it can give up to form Na. This electron
can combine with the alcoholic proton to form a hydrogen atom (remember that
a hydrogen atom is a proton and an electron). Two hydrogen atoms give hydrogen
gas (H2), which can escape from the reaction flask, pushing the reaction to completion.
This process effectively deprotonates the alcohol (turns it into an alkoxide),
forms Na as the counter-ion, and liberates hydrogen gas.
Now that we have seen how to deprotonate an alcohol (to form an alkoxide),
the obvious question is: what can we do with alkoxide ions? We have already seen
that alkoxide ions can be used as strong bases. But alkoxides can also function as
strong nucleophiles. For example, consider the following SN2 reaction:
This is not a new reaction. This is just an SN2 reaction. We are simply using the
alkoxide ion (ethoxide in this case) to function as the attacking nucleophile. But notice
the net result of this reaction: we have combined an alcohol and an alkyl halide
to form an ether. This process has a special name. It is called the Williamson Ether
Synthesis. This process relies on an SN2 reaction as the main step, and therefore, we
must be careful to obey the restrictions of SN2 reactions. It is best to use a primary
alkyl halide. Secondary alkyl halides cannot be used because elimination will predominate
over substitution (as seen in Sections 10.9), and tertiary alkyl halides certainly
cannot be used.

ANSWER We are using a Williamson Ether synthesis, so we will need to start

(retrosynthetic analysis), we get the following:
This retrosynthetic analysis tells us that we can make our product from sodium
propoxide and propyl chloride. We can prepare sodium propoxide by treating propanol
with Na. In summary, our answer is:

Synthesis is really just the flipside of predicting products. In any reaction, there
are three groups of chemicals involved: the starting material, the reagents, and the
products:
When the products are not shown, then you have a “predict the product” problem:
When the reagents are not shown, then you have a synthesis problem:
Synthesis problems can be easy (if they are only one step) or they can be difficult
(if they are more than one step). When you begin learning reactions in your
course, you will start to encounter synthesis problems in your textbook. At first, you
will get one-step problems, and as the course progresses, you will see multistep
syntheses. In a multistep synthesis, you can often end up with a product that looks
very different from the starting material. For example, look at the following series
of reactions below. Don’t concentrate on how the changes were made. For now, just
focus on the fact that each reaction changes the compound only slightly, but in the
end, we end up with a product completely different from the starting material:

SYNTHESIS
13.1 ONE-STEP SYNTHESES 333
It can only take three or four steps before the problem can get quite difficult.
If you convert the sequence above into a synthesis problem, it would look like this:
If you are having trouble with synthesis problems when you first encounter
them, the worst thing you can do is to give up and say: “Oh, well, I’m not good at
synthesis problems.” As the course moves on, this attitude will slowly kill your grade
in the course. To see why this is so, let’s compare organic chemistry to a game
of chess.
Imagine that you are learning how to play chess. You first learn about the
pieces: how they are named, how to set up the board, and so on. Then you learn how
each piece moves and how they capture each other. When you start playing your first
game, you realize that there is quite a bit of strategy involved. Most strategies involve
thinking more than just one move in advance. It is not good enough to know
only how to move the pieces. You also need to think about how to plan out the next
few moves so that you can coordinate an attack on your opponent’s pieces. Imagine
how silly it would be to take the time to learn how to move the pieces, but to then
say to yourself that you are not good at strategy. Imagine thinking that you will keep
playing chess, but you just won’t be good at that one aspect of the game. That would
be silly, because that one aspect of the game is the whole game itself. You either need
to learn how to strategize, or just don’t play chess. There is no in-between.
Organic chemistry is very much the same. Synthesis is all about strategizing.
You need to think a few moves ahead, and you must learn how to do this. You cannot
tell yourself that you are not good at synthesis problems, and therefore you will
just focus on the other aspects of organic chemistry. Synthesis is organic chemistry.
The second half of the course is all about learning reactions and applying them in
syntheses. Everything that you have learned so far has prepared you for synthesis.
The only way to become proficient at synthesis is to practice. Don’t be lazy, and
don’t think that you can get through the course without learning how to propose
syntheses. If you do, you will find that your performance in the course will spiral
down to a point that will make you very unhappy.
There are a few techniques that will make you feel more comfortable with synthesis
problems, and there are exercises that you can go through to increase your proficiency
in doing synthesis problems. That’s what this chapter is all about.
13.1 ONE-STEP SYNTHESES
As we mentioned earlier, one-step syntheses are the first synthesis problems you will
encounter. They will never be more difficult than predicting products. Before you
can move on to multistep syntheses, you first need to feel comfortable with one-step
syntheses.
? O
To do this, we need to make a list of reactions, but we will leave out the
reagents, so that we can repeatedly photocopy the list and get practice filling in the
reagents.
As you learn more and more reactions, this list will grow. With every five new
reactions, you should photocopy all of the reactions that you have recorded here.
Then, start filling in the reagents on the photocopy. Repeat this procedure whenever
you have entered five new reactions.
If you keep up with this exercise as the course progresses, you will be in very
good shape for solving one-step synthesis problems. The hardest challenge that you
will face is keeping up with the work and not waiting until the night before the exam.
If you wait (as most students do), you will find it very difficult to spend the time that
it takes to master this material. Don’t make that mistake. The secret to success in this
course is to do a little bit every night (rather than cramming on the night before the
exam). Cramming might work well for other courses, but it doesn’t work well in organic
chemistry.
Begin your list on the next page.
For now, skip forward a few pages. We have some techniques to go over that will help
you solve synthesis problems.

344 CHAPTER 13 SYNTHESIS
13.2 MULTISTEP SYNTHESES 345
If you cover more than 30 reactions and need more space to continue, then you can
just use a regular piece of paper to keep your list going.
13.2 MULTISTEP SYNTHESES
To prepare yourself for solving multistep syntheses, you need to learn how to think
in more than one move. If you carefully review your list of reactions, you will find
that the products of some reactions are the starting material for other reactions. For
example, you will find that some reactions are used to form double bonds, and other
reactions add reagents across double bonds. So if you pair up all of the possibilities,
you will create a list of many two-step syntheses. By studying these two-step
possibilities, you will begin to get familiar with seeing syntheses that are more than
one step.
Let’s see an example of what we mean. Below is one reaction that forms a
double bond. It starts with an alkyne, and you will certainly learn this reaction at
some point:
Now consider one of the reactions where reagents react with a double bond:
If we put these two reactions together into a two-step synthesis, we get the
following:
You should now get some practice with this. You will probably learn around five
methods for making double bonds and probably around 10 reactions that involve
reagents reacting with double bonds. If you put together all of the possibilities, you
will find that there are around 50 possibilities, depending on exactly how many reactions
you learn. Clearly, you cannot keep a list like this as you go through the
course. The list would be too long to study. And if you try to consider three-step syntheses,
you will find that the number of permutations is too large to even compile
such a list. It’s just like our analogy to a game of chess.
In chess, you cannot possibly memorize every possible orientation of all of the
pieces and then memorize the best move for each of those possibilities. There are too

2) Os
3) H2O2
O4

2) H2O2

many permutations. Instead, you learn how to analyze each situation and as time
goes on, you get better and better at it. By familiarizing yourself with certain permutations,
you will get better at figuring things out as you go along. So let’s start
with the list that we talked about above—the approximately 50 possible two-step
syntheses that involve forming a double bond and then doing something to that double
bond.
Again, you should not try to make a list like this throughout your entire course.
This task would be impractical. But if you make this first list of roughly 50 syntheses,
you will learn how to start thinking in more than one step. It is important for you
to get accustomed to thinking this way. Take a separate sheet of paper and try to create
this list using the reactions in the beginning of your course. If you do not get a
chance to write down all 50, that’s OK. As long as you begin the process and draw
at least 10 or 20 of them, then you will start to understand what it is like to think in
more than one step.
After you have done this, we can start focusing on the main techniques for analyzing
problems that display permutations that you have never seen. That is what
the next section is all about.
13.3 RETROSYNTHETIC ANALYSIS
When you see a synthesis problem for the first time, you are not expected to immediately
know the answer. I cannot stress this enough. It is so common for students
to get overly anxious when they see synthesis problems that they cannot
solve. Get used to it. This is the way it is supposed to be. Going back to our chess
analogy, you don’t need to make a move as soon as it is your turn. You are allowed
to think about it first. In fact, you are supposed to think about it first. So, how do
you begin thinking about a multistep synthesis problem where you do not immediately
see the solution? The most powerful technique is called retrosynthetic analysis.
This means that you analyze the problem backward. Let’s see how this works
with an example:
The synthesis problem above is a multistep synthesis problem, because we do not
have a single reaction that allows us to do this transformation in just one step. So the
best way to start is to first look at the product and work our way backward.
We see that the product is a dibromide. So we ask ourselves: Do we know any
way of making a dibromide? You can see that to answer this question, you must have
first mastered one-step syntheses. If you have not yet done this for all of the reactions
that you have learned so far, you will need to go back to the beginning of this
chapter and do that first (if you are a student in this situation, continue reading for
now, so you can see where this is all going).

?
346 CHAPTER 13 SYNTHESIS
13.4 CREATING YOUR OWN PROBLEMS 347
So we should be able to recognize that we know how to make dibromides from
double bonds. We draw the alkene that would have been used to form the product:
Now we are one step closer to solving this problem. The next step is to ask if there is
a way to turn the starting material into this double bond. And there is. We just do an
elimination reaction to get the double bond. So now we have solved our synthesis by
working backward:
Notice that the stereochemistry and regiochemistry needs to work out for
every step. You cannot use a step that has the wrong stereochemistry or regiochemistry.
I suppose you could have memorized all possible two-step syntheses from the
reactions in your textbook, and then you would have gotten this problem right away
(maybe . . .), but that is not a practical approach. What will you do for three-step or
four-step syntheses? You need to get accustomed to thinking backward. The more
practice you can get, the better off you will be.
Here is where we run into a big problem. There is no way for me to give you problems
that are appropriate. Every course goes at its own pace, in its own order, and with
exams at different points in the course. I cannot give problems that will be perfectly appropriate
for every student everywhere. So, how are we going to get practice? Very simply.
You are going to make your own problems, as described in the next section.
13.4 CREATING YOUR OWN PROBLEMS
Creating your own problems is easier than it sounds. You just choose any reaction
from the lists that you have been making (in Chapters 8 and 13). Then look at the
product of that reaction and choose another reaction that you have learned that will
Br
Br2
Br
? Br
NaOEt
Br
Br2
Br
? Br
transform that compound into something else. We work backward to solve synthesis
problems, but we work forward to create a synthesis problem. At each step, draw the
product of that reaction and then move on to the next step. After you have gone two
or three or four steps, erase everything in the middle. Just draw the very first compound
and the final product. Draw an arrow between them, and you have a synthesis
problem.
There is one catch. You will not find that problem to be very challenging, because
you are the one who made it. So here is what you should do. Find a friend in
the course, and each of you should make up 10 or 20 problems. Then you switch off
with each other. You will find that this is a very effective method for studying. The
larger your study group becomes, the more effective it will be. Don’t be shy. You will
need to work with a friend to get the practice that you need, not to mention the valuable
peer support. If you are reading this book, then chances are that other students
in your course have this book also. They will have the same need that you do. Team
up with them.
Even if you cannot find a friend with whom you can swap problems, it will
still be a useful exercise to create your own problems. The process of creating problems
by itself is a worthwhile process. It will help you get accustomed to thinking in
multiple steps for synthesis problems.
To summarize, these are the keys to becoming proficient at solving synthesis
problems:
1. Master the one-step syntheses by constant review.
2. Train yourself to work backward when solving a problem.
3. And, finally, get lots of practice.
